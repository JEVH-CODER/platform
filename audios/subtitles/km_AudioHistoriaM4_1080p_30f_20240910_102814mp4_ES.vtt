6
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.700 
Back in 1966, there was a young boy named

7
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.320 
Benny Carson who lived in Detroit.

8
00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.280 
Benny was not very good at school, and

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.940 
this made his classmates laugh at him.

10
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.600 
One day, he got really angry and hit one

11
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.240 
of them in the head.

12
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.320 
This made his mother, Sonia Carson, get

13
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.740 
called into the principal's office.

14
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.560 
After the meeting, Benny felt really sad.

15
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.380 
He thought that he was not smart.

16
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.400 
His mother, however, believed in him.

17
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.040 
She told him that he was not stupid, but
very smart, and that he just needed to

18
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.660 
work harder.

19
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.100 
Still, she was worried.

20
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.520 
She did not want her sons, Ben and
Curtis, to end up with jobs that they did

21
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.040 
not like, because they weren't doing well
in school.

22
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.220 
To help Benny do better, Sonia started
helping him with his schoolwork.

23
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
This is when she found out that Benny was
having trouble seeing.

24
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.280 
She quickly got him glasses, which helped
him do better in school.

25
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.640 
Benny often felt that he was not as good
as his classmates, but Sonia always told

26
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.140 
him to concentrate on his studies.

27
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.600 
Benny's life changed when he went to a

28
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.800 
church service one Sunday.

29
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.160 
The pastor told a story about a brave

30
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
doctor who helped poor people, even
though it was dangerous.

31
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.800 
This story really touched Benny and made
him want to become a doctor who helps others.

32
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.200 
Sonia was dealing with a lot of personal troubles.

33
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.560 
She regularly visited a psychiatrist, and

34
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.160 
she told him about her hard life.

35
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.460 
She spent her childhood in foster care,

36
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.600 
without a real family.

37
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.260 
At just 13, she married Carson.

38
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.720 
Later, she found out that Carson had
another family that he hid from her.

39
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
Despite their best efforts, their
marriage fell apart and ended in divorce.

40
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.480 
Now Sonia works multiple jobs, like
cleaning and babysitting, to support her family.

41
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.080 
Sonia can't read or write, and this
scares her.

42
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.560 
She's worried that her sons might end up
facing the same challenges.

43
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.460 
She even tells her psychiatrist about her
thoughts of ending her life, which

44
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.140 
worries him.

45
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.300 
He suggests that she should spend some

46
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.120 
time in a hospital for her mental health.

47
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.020 
During dinner, Sonia tells her sons that

48
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.900 
she will have to be away for a few weeks.

49
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.360 
She doesn't tell them why, but she urges

50
00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.780 
them to concentrate on their schoolwork,
because she believes that getting a good

51
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.180 
education is the key to a better life for them.

52
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.380 
While Sonia is in the hospital, her son

53
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.820 
Benny keeps his promise to her
.

54
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.280 
He starts working harder in school.

55
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.080 
His hard work pays off when he receives

56
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.580 
his first a grade.

57
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.320 
When Sonia comes home from the hospital,

58
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.940 
and Benny shows her his grade, she feels
so proud of him.

59
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.900 
Sonia comes home from the hospital.
