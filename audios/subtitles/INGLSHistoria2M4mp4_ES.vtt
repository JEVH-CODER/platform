Escucha esta producción varias veces

3

hasta que la entiendas bien.

4
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.340 
Recuerda que la meta es que puedes

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.000 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.100 
A diner at a high -end restaurant is

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.460 
acting all high and mighty while ordering
food from the waiter.

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.760 
Stressed out, the waiter messes up a few
times, which makes the customer even more angry.

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.120 
Before serving the food, the waiter
secretly adds a pinch of salt and spits

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.440 
on it.

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.920 
Check out how it all went down

12
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.540 
.

13
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.540 
What does this mean?

14
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.580 
This lasagna is terrible.

15
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.580 
Oh my gosh.

16
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.140 
The chef must have dropped the ball.

17
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.740 
I don't care.

18
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.560 
I'm not here for excuses.

19
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.640 
Do you understand?

20
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:49.280 
Yes sir, my bad.

21
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.740 
What can we get you instead?

22
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.320 
I need a drink.

23
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.940 
Bring me some hot chocolate with powdered gold.

24
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.840 
Alright, anything else?

25
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.040 
No, that's it.

26
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.840 
How much is it?

27
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.560 
Alright, that will be $8 ,000 .00.

28
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.020 
See, I'm shelling out good money here, so
step up your game.

29
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.540 
Understood, sir.

30
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.220 
The waiter slips into the kitchen.

31
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.680 
Why is he angry?

32
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.340 
What happened to him?

33
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
He said the lasagna was a train wreck.

34
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.560 
Oh no.

35
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.200 
I'm freaking out here.

36
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.400 
I'm at my wit's end now.

37
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.340 
Why's that?

38
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.020 
Um...

39
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.000 
I'm scared I'll get the boot.
