6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.520 
Welcome to today's debate on whether

7
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.420 
governments should have the authority to
prohibit social media in their country.

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.200 
We have two panelists, Alex who will
argue in favor of prohibition and Jamie

9
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.600 
who will argue against it.

10
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.440 
Let's begin with opening statements

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.780 
.

12
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.260 
Thank you.

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620 
To start, I would like to highlight that,
in the past, several governments have

14
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.540 
used various means to control the flow of information.

15
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.340 
For instance, back in the early 2000s,

16
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.740 
some governments used to restrict
internet access during times of political unrest.

17
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.940 
This history suggests that it is not
unprecedented for governments to exert

18
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.920 
control over digital platforms.

19
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.720 
Looking to the future, governments might

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.640 
be about to implement stricter
regulations on social media due to

21
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.680 
increasing concerns about misinformation
and security.

22
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.300 
Social media platforms are often seen as
breeding grounds for harmful content,

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060 
which can lead to significant social unrest.

24
00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.000 
Governments could, therefore, have the

25
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.660 
obligation to intervene to maintain
public order.

26
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.740 
Thank you, Alex.

27
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.240 
While it's true that some governments

28
00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.520 
have intervened in the past, it's crucial
to consider the implications of such actions.

29
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.680 
The prohibition of social media would
likely lead to unintended consequences.

30
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.080 
For example, when governments prohibited
social media in the past, the results

31
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.460 
were often counterproductive.

32
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.360 
People found alternative methods to

33
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.700 
communicate and share information,
sometimes even making the situation worse.

34
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.140 
Speculating about the future, if a
government were to ban social media, it

35
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.780 
could face considerable backlash from the
public and international community.

36
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.100 
The necessity to preserve free speech and
the right to access information might

37
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.400 
outweigh the perceived benefits of such a prohibition.

38
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.320 
But we must not ignore the fact that

39
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.440 
social media can spread harmful content
that can have real -world consequences.

40
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.680 
For instance, social media platforms were
used to incite violence in various countries.

41
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.480 
If governments have the authority to
regulate these platforms, they would be

42
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.800 
able to prevent the spread of dangerous content.

43
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.840 
In this case, governments would have to

44
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.060 
act, despite the potential backlash.

45
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.980 
While it's important to address harmful

46
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.920 
content, banning social media might not
be the most effective solution.

47
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.500 
Governments should instead focus on
improving digital literacy and creating

48
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.240 
regulations that target the misuse of
social media without completely

49
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.500 
prohibiting it.

50
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.420 
The right approach would be to balance

51
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.660 
regulation with the preservation of free speech.

52
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.920 
Moreover, the argument that prohibiting

53
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.140 
social media would lead to increased
underground activity doesn't necessarily

54
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.900 
hold water.

55
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.400 
Negative adverbials aside, the primary

56
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
concern is the safety and security of the public.

57
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.500 
By controlling what is shared online,

58
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.880 
governments could prevent the
dissemination of harmful information.

59
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.000 
Nonetheless, considering the present, it
is vital that governments find a way to

60
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.120 
adapt to the digital age without
resorting to extreme measures.

61
00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.220 
The future of social media and its role
in society should be managed with careful

62
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.780 
thought rather than sweeping bans.

63
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.440 
The government's role should be about

64
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.360 
finding balanced solutions that uphold
democratic values while addressing

65
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.240 
genuine concerns.

66
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.780 
In conclusion, while a complete ban on

67
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.840 
social media might be a drastic measure,
governments may need to consider it as

68
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.220 
part of a broader strategy.

69
00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.740 
The need for security might justify such

70
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.300 
actions in specific circumstances
, even though it is an approach that

71
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.940 
should be used with caution.

72
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.100 
In summary, it is crucial to approach the

73
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.820 
issue with a nuanced perspective.

74
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.980 
The future of social media regulation

75
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.860 
should involve a combination of
strategies, rather than an outright ban,

76
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.320 
to ensure that freedom of expression is
preserved while addressing legitimate concerns.

77
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.160 
Thank you, Alex and Jamie, for your
insightful arguments.

78
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.440 
This concludes our debate on whether the
government can or should prohibit social

79
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.560 
media in their country.

80
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.080 
Take care, and I'll see you in the next one.
