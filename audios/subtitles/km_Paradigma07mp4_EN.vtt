1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.280 
Going on with the story.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.360 
Finally, the chosen common destination

3
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.860 
was the United States.

4
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.560 
Everyone started packing their bags.

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.080 
Some were over the moon because it was
the country of their dreams, while others

6
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.120 
did so with a heavy heart, knowing that
the journey to this country would be no

7
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.880 
walk in the park.

8
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.640 
Still, there was a shared feeling among

9
00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.040 
them that no one wanted to admit.

10
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.500 
Uncertainty.

11
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.780 
Will we make it?

12
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.760 
They all wondered.

13
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.340 
Since there were so many people, it
wasn't safe to travel all together in one

14
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.760 
go, so they split into two different options.

15
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.640 
Hit the road.

16
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.760 
They would use cars and motorcycles up to
a certain point.

17
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.940 
After that, they would hoof it for seven
weeks to reach the meeting point.

18
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
Take to the water.

19
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.820 
They would raft it across the sea,

20
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.580 
arriving in about four weeks.

21
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.160 
Some preferred to reach their destination

22
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.440 
overland, imagining they might find some
pit stops along the way.

23
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.840 
Plus, they were terrified of the water
since they didn't know how to swim.

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.300 
They figured the bears and pumas roaming
those jungles would be spooked by such a

25
00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.860 
large group.

26
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.760 
Others decided to set sail by water.

27
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.700 
Fewer risks of getting mugged, and the
journey would be a lot quicker.

28
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.780 
the tidal ages of Jahre ask less cierto,
It would ethnic group dressing and under

29
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.000 
the instructor, I have left here a RICH位.

30
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.260 
We decide everything
