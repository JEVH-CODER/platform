2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.280 
Escucha esta producción varias veces

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.880 
hasta que la entiendas bien.

4
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.340 
Recuerda que la meta es que puedes

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.000 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:21.820 
Good evening.

7
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.060 
We're gonna start with breaking news from
a quiet suburban area where a tragic

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.560 
accident has just happened.

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.320 
A man, reported to be drunk, was driving

10
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.820 
alone in his car when he crashed into a tree.

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.340 
The impact was severe, and the man was

12
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.200 
thrown through the air, falling 500
meters from the crash site.

13
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.500 
He landed under a bridge that also serves
as a main road.

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.890 
When emergency services arrived to
retrieve the body, they were shocked to

15
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.190 
find, right in front of them, not one,
but two bodies at the scene.

16
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.810 
Our reporter Diana went to that tragic
place, and she's there now.

17
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.430 
Please, Diana, tell us more about it.

18
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.170 
That's right.

19
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.530 
Authorities have confirmed that one of
the bodies is indeed the driver of the car.

20
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.350 
However, the second body, which was found
next to it, was just discovered that this

21
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.390 
second person had been deceased for a
couple of days before being found, and

22
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.930 
their identity remains unknown.

23
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.910 
Many are wondering, whose body is this?

24
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.530 
There are speculations that this
individual might be someone involved in

25
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.050 
the criminal activities reported around
this bridge.

26
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.810 
Neighbors have raised concerns that the
bridge has become a hideout for thieves

27
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.270 
and drug addicts who caused much harm.

28
00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.370 
With everything they did, they made this

29
00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.130 
place dangerous, they said.

30
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.770 
They think it's most likely that the

31
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.970 
unidentified body belongs to one of those
criminals, and many people say that it is

32
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.330 
not worth investigating or closing the road.

33
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.510 
However, a few people supported by a

34
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.990 
human rights organization say they'll go
and file a complaint about such an act of

35
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.370 
intolerance and savagery by the neighbors.

36
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.710 
There is a lot of confusion, yet little

37
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.410 
is known.

38
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.790 
You continue on, studio, Carla.

39
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.540 
Sure, in an attempt to understand the
situation better, authorities are

40
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.640 
investigating further.

41
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.160 
They want to determine if there is a

42
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.820 
connection between the two deaths and
what exactly led to this tragic series of events.

43
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.180 
They have stated that it's too early to
draw any conclusions, and they assure the

44
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.960 
public that they will do their job and
make this case clear.

45
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.860 
For now, the investigation continues, and
we will keep you updated with any new developments.

46
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.960 
Back to you.
