1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.380 
Angelica, a dedicated lawyer and loving
mom, devoted her life to her family.

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.160 
She had always envisioned a beautiful
future with her children.

3
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.800 
Graduations, birthdays, weddings, and the
sweet sound of grandchildren running

4
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.580 
through her house.

5
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.400 
However, everything fell apart during a

6
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.860 
routine checkup when the doctor delivered
the devastating news.

7
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.040 
She had cancer.

8
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.180 
I'm sorry, Angelica.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.620 
You have approximately three months to live.

10
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.780 
Said Dr. Moreno, his voice echoing coldly

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.280 
in the room.

12
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.920 
Angelica felt as though her heart had

13
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.660 
been ripped out.

14
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.020 
What about her dreams?

15
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.320 
What would happen to her children, Lucas,
Sarah, and Daniel?

16
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
Worry consumed her, but she decided she
couldn't let fear rule her remaining days.

17
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.620 
With courage, Angelica called her three
children, saying, Take me to eat wherever

18
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.460 
I want.

19
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.580 
I want to enjoy my last days.

20
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.200 
She smiled, even though it was forced.

21
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
In her mind, a burning desire ignited, to

22
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.200 
live every moment to the fullest.

23
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.800 
On the weekend, when they arrived at the

24
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.140 
restaurant, Angelica ordered a feast.

25
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.540 
Meat, chicken, seafood, and all the

26
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.620 
juices she craved.

27
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.520 
Mom, you can't eat that.

28
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.440 
It's too much.

29
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.900 
Lucas interrupted, concern in his eyes.

30
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.000 
I love you, son, but please let me die in peace.

31
00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.240 
I want to enjoy what I have left.

32
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.300 
She replied firmly.

33
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.480 
Then, she knelt at the table and prayed.

34
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.520 
Lord, thank you for the life you've given me.

35
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.420 
I'm grateful for your love and these

36
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.780 
three months I have left.

37
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.620 
I will use them living fully and helping others.

38
00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.260 
Days turned into weeks, and surprisingly,
Angelica was still alive.

39
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.000 
During those three months, she lived her
best life ever.

40
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.700 
A lot of trips with her children, family
dinners, and laughter.

41
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.920 
Each passing day was a gift.

42
00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.480 
On day 91, her children began to doubt.

43
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.320 
Really?

44
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.160 
Where's the death that was supposed to come?

45
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
Daniel commented sarcastically.

46
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.540 
Angelica smiled and replied.

47
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.720 
Maybe death got confused and took someone else.

48
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.200 
Seven months later, the family gathered

49
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.620 
for a special dinner to celebrate her survival.

50
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.040 
Angelica felt good, with renewed energy.

51
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.700 
I feel incredible.

52
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.740 
She told her siblings and children.

53
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.300 
It seems the cancer has forgotten me.

54
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.140 
After a medical checkup, Dr. Valeria was stunned.

55
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.260 
I can't explain it, Angelica, but the
tests show the cancer is gone.

56
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.140 
She said in amazement, Angelica, shocked,
looked up at the sky, tears streaming

57
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.720 
down her face in happiness.

58
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.660 
From that day on, her favorite song

59
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.780 
became, To God Be the Glory.

60
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.280 
Her children and their dad, her husband

61
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.100 
witnessing this miracle, decided to
surrender to Jesus, grateful for the gift

62
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.640 
of their mother.

63
00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.060 
Angelica's husband, Juan, also joined

64
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.860 
them, and together they chose to live not
only for themselves, but to help others.

65
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.320 
Years passed, and Angelica's family
became a beacon of hope in their community.

66
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.520 
They started helping the poor, organizing
community kitchens and donations.

67
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.740 
Angelica, who once feared death, now
lived with renewed purpose.

68
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.020 
At a community gathering, she shared her story.

69
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.500 
Cancer taught me to value every day.

70
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.620 
I thank God for giving me another chance.

71
00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.500 
I don't just live for myself, but for

72
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.480 
those who need hope.

73
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.840 
Her children, inspired by her example,

74
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.840 
joined her mission, forming a family
united by love, faith, and generosity.

75
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.920 
Each day was a celebration of life, an
opportunity to give and share.

76
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.060 
Over time, Angelica's family expanded.

77
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.880 
Grandchildren arrived, filling her home

78
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.420 
with laughter and joy.

79
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.520 
Angelica, now wiser and stronger, passed

80
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.140 
on to her children and grandchildren the
importance of living with purpose and gratitude.

81
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.800 
Living fully doesn't mean having much,
but giving much.

82
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.660 
She taught them.

83
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.620 
True wealth is found in love and generosity.

84
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.600 
Thus, Angelica and her family turned
their pain into strength, becoming a

85
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.240 
symbol of hope in their community, living
each day as a gift.

86
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.760 
Their story was not only a testimony of
faith and perseverance, but also a lesson

87
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.360 
in the power of love and the ability to
overcome adversity.
