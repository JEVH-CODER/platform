00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.280 
Fernando is between a rock and a hard place.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.620 
His owner wants to kick him out of the house.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.220 
Just this morning, he got in trouble.

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.300 
When his owner was at the supermarket

5
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.600 
buying some things for lunch, Fernando
sat on the table.

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.920 
Beside him, on the table, there was tuna
so Fernando ate it.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.100 
Then he saw a pot in front of him, so he
jumped and fell inside the pot that had

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.880 
fish soup in it.

9
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.620 
The pot wasn't hot yet.

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.980 
His owner had left the pot on low heat
for safety while she was at the supermarket.

11
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.480 
Fernando ate so much that he fell asleep
inside the pot.

12
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.620 
When his owner came home, she put the pot
on the high heat and started looking for

13
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.420 
Fernando, but he was well hidden.

14
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.940 
He was inside the pot.

15
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.740 
After a few minutes, his owner heard the
pot moving violently.

16
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.100 
Could it be that a fish was alive?

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.040 
Fernando's owner uncovered the pot, and

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.460 
something furry shot out.

19
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.360 
It was Fernando, who was terrified and

20
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.220 
hid under the table.

21
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.300 
His owner tried to get him out from under

22
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.980 
the table with a broom, but Fernando
climbed up her face and hid behind the

23
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.200 
stove in front of the fridge.

24
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.360 
However, he was too near the hot pot, so

25
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.800 
hid beside the cold fridge.

26
00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.840 
When his owner was going to reach him, he

27
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.980 
jumped, went outside, and scrambled up a tree.

28
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.420 
Fernando is still outside in the tree.

29
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.080 
He doesn't want to come down, but he is
very hungry, so he's still between a rock

30
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.920 
and a hard place.

31
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.080 
Let's do this.
