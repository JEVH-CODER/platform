00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.280 
Fernando is between a rock and a hard place.

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.620 
His owner wants to kick him out of the house.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.220 
Just this morning, he got in trouble.

4
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.300 
When his owner was at the supermarket

5
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.600 
buying some things for lunch, Fernando
sat on the table.

6
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.920 
Beside him, on the table, there was tuna
so Fernando ate it.

7
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.100 
Then he saw a pot in front of him, so he
jumped and fell inside the pot that had

8
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.880 
fish soup in it.

9
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.620 
The pot wasn't hot yet.

10
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.980 
His owner had left the pot on low heat
for safety while she was at the supermarket.

11
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
Fernando ate so much that he fell asleep
inside the pot.

12
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.620 
When his owner came home, she put the pot
on the high heat and started looking for

13
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.440 
Fernando, but he was well hidden.

14
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.940 
He was inside the pot.

15
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.740 
After a few minutes, his owner heard the
pot moving violently.

16
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.100 
Could it be that a fish was alive?

17
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.040 
Fernando's owner uncovered the pot, and

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.040 
something furry shot out
.

19
00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.960 
It was Fernando, who was terrified and
hid under the table.

20
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.620 
His owner tried to get him out from under
the table with a broom, but Fernando

21
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.860 
climbed up her face and hid behind the
stove in front of the fridge.

22
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.460 
However, he was too near the hot pot, so
hid beside the cold fridge.

23
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.900 
When his owner was going to reach him, he
jumped, went outside, and scrambled up a tree.

24
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.100 
Fernando is still outside in the tree.

25
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.040 
He doesn't want to come down, but he is

26
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.940 
very hungry, so he's still between a rock
and a hard place.

27
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.020 
I feel like I'm tired of saving his own house.

28
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.080 
Even in his house, where he is.

29
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.400 
He is really hungry, and he's hungry.

30
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.400 
You're hungry.
