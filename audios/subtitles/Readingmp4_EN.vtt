00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.400 
Ok, now we will practice our reading
ability, so what you will do is the

2
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.620 
following, first you will listen to the
audio while you read the PDF or the text

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.940 
in a low voice, ok, second you will learn
all the words of the text that you still

4
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.700 
do not know, ok, you will learn these words.

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.270 
Next, you’ll listen to the audio again

6
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.700 
while you read the text aloud or read it quietly to yourself.

7
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.940 
This way, you’ll practice and remember the words you’ve just learned.

8
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.060 
And finally, you must read in a loud

9
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.760 
voice, making sure that you are having a
good pronunciation, so have the audio at

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.060 
hand so you can check if you need it.
