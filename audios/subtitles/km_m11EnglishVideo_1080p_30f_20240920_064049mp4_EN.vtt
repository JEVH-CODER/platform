Chapter 3: The successful politician Early beginnings In 2015,

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.280
Doctor Ben Carson, celebrated for his groundbreaking
work as a neurosurgeon, ventured into the political

6
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.640
arena with the aim of securing the Republican nomination
for president of the United States.

7
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.120
He smelled the opportunity in the in the air.
Nevertheless, not once did he underestimate the

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.440
challenges he would face in this highly competitive race.
One could feel it was going to be extremely tough because

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.680
he would have to compete against candidates such as Donald
Trump, Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz.

10
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.550
Controversial issues.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.120
Doctor Carson had strong and clear opinions on
controversial issues on abortion.

12
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.360
He was firmly pro-life, advocating for the protection
of unborn children.

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.700
He believed that life begins at conception and opposed
abortion except in cases where the mother's life was at risk

14
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.030
On drug policy, Carson supported a tough stance
on illegal drugs, but also emphasized the importance

15
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.470
of addressing addiction through rehabilitation rather than
solely through punitive measures.

16
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.470
Campaign events As the campaign progressed, Dr.
Carson was often seen at various events delivering speeches

17
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.950
and participating in debates.
He used to emphasize his outsider perspective and medical

18
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.150
expertise, hoping to appeal to voters who valued
these traits.

19
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.230
Doctor Carson would often reflect on his experiences as a
neurosurgeon during his campaign.

20
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.979
He saw that the competition was fierce setbacks and
withdrawal.

21
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.430
In March 2016, following a disappointing Super
Tuesday performance, Carson decided to suspend

22
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.790
his campaign.
His decision was influenced by the realization that he was

23
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.140
unlikely to secure the nomination due to his inability to
compete effectively against his better funded and more

24
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.790
politically connected rivals.
After all, he had been a neurosurgeon all his

25
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.789
life and not a politician like the others. 
Never had he faced such a challenging political environment.

26
00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:11.380
And so he tasted the bitterness of defeat early in the
race.

27
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.510
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

28
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.790
In 2017, Doctor Carson got appointed as the Secretary
of Housing and Urban Development, HUD by President

29
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.750
Donald Trump.
There were speculations about how Carson might get another

30
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.870
chance to run for office again in the future,
whether as a senator or in another significant role.

31
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.030
His political career, characterized by how he
got to transition from a renowned neurosurgeon to a public

32
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.840
servant, showcased how he got used to his new
role and the challenges it brought.

33
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.150
This transition showed how Doctor Carson got to adapt and
thrive in a completely different field.

34
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.141
Demonstrating his versatility and commitment to public
service.
