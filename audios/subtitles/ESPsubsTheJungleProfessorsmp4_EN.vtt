00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:08.180 
the jungle professors by day professor
lucas and dr maria were beloved

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.320 
university teachers lucas taught zoology
and maria specialized in anthropology

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.180 
they were respected by students and
colleagues alike for their vast knowledge

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.240 
yet once night fell their lives changed
entirely the couple lived deep in the

5
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.020 
jungle in a hidden cabin surrounded by
towering trees and wild animals lucas

6
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.500 
asked maria how often do you think
someone will notice our double life maria

7
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.840 
smiled once in a blue moon maybe who
would ever think that two university

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.620 
professors could live such a savage life
out here every once in a while they'd

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.120 
walk through the dense forest talking
about their day at the university but as

10
00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:01.610 
soon as the sun set they became hunters
they'd go deep into the jungle searching

11
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.030 
for animals to kill and make clothing
from it wasn't just any clothing though

12
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.930 
these weren't your typical professors
their outfits were made from the finest

13
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.490 
animal hides fur and feathers these look
snatched lucas would say after crafting a

14
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.910 
new outfit the jungle had its own rules
and they followed them their clothing was

15
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.110 
a flex showing off their jungle skills
one night as they hunted a wild jaguar

16
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:36.210 
lucas pulled maria aside look out it's
coming toward us it's coming toward us he

17
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:59.290 
said the jaguar lunge but with swift
movements lucas took it down maria panted

18
00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.870 
that was lit we got ourselves a new
outfit but their secret wasn't easy to

19
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.030 
keep what happens if someone from the
university finds out maria wondered aloud

20
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.850 
that would be like letting the cat out of
the bag lucas said but don't worry we'll

21
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.710 
ghost anyone who gets too close right
maria added plus who would believe us

22
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.190 
when pigs fly someone might think we're
out here hunting animals by night despite

23
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.410 
their savage night lives the couple
maintained their university facade their

24
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.590 
students would never know that their
professors dressed in fine tailored suits

25
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.990 
during the day spent the night weaving
jaguar skins into clothing themselves but

26
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.080 
every once in a while maria would notice
a student's suspicious glance brah do

27
00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.380 
they know she'd ask lucas stop being so
shook he'd reply they're barking up the

28
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.060 
wrong tree if they think we're anything
but boring professors one day maria

29
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.560 
overheard a student asking a colleague
excuse me have you thought about what

30
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.560 
professors lucas and maria do after class
the colleague laughed sorry i didn't

31
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:26.860 
catch that are you serious maria's heart
raced maria's heart raced but she kept

32
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.600 
her cool sorry she said and then thought
to herself maybe they're just pulling

33
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:41.020 
someone's leg when someone asked how old
they were lucas would laugh old enough to

34
00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.680 
know better but young enough to still
slay at night they lived a double life

35
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.080 
flawlessly they hit the books by day and
hit the jungle by night killing two birds

36
00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.040 
with one stone maintaining both their
careers and their wild passions but the

37
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:04.220 
jungle was dangerous one night lucas
almost bit off more than he could chew

38
00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:30.430 
when they faced a ferocious pack of
wolves maria saved the day by using her

39
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:42.820 
knowledge of the jungle to outweep them
that was close she said maybe we should

40
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.780 
call it a day before one of us ends up
kicking the bucket yeah lucas agreed but

41
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:55.680 
hey we'll still be back tomorrow this
life is too bustin to stop as they sat in

42
00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.860 
front of their cabin maria turned to
lucas is it okay if we take a break

43
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:09.380 
tomorrow i could use a little rest sure
go ahead lucas replied we've earned it

44
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.600 
break a leg out there tomorrow have you
thought about how we can make this easier

45
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
maria suggested maybe we should ask for
help from our colleagues good idea lucas

46
00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:28.580 
said but i hate to think what they would
say if they knew and so the couple

47
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.220 
continued their wild dual existence they
live for the thrill of the hunt and love

48
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.080 
the challenge of balancing their jungle
lives with their academic careers every

49
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.160 
once in a while they'd spill the tea on
their adventures to a close friend but

50
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:49.060 
only enough to keep the truth hidden
after all in front of the classroom they

51
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.620 
were just regular teachers but in the
jungle they were something entirely different
