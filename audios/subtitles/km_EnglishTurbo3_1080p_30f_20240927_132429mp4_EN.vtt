1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.630 
Angelica, a dedicated lawyer and

2
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.870 
loving mom, devoted her life to

3
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.950 
her family.

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.030 
She had always envisioned a beautiful

5
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.870 
future with her children, graduations,

6
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.350 
birthdays, weddings, and the sweet

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.510 
sound of grandchildren running through

8
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.190 
her house.

9
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.990 
However, everything fell apart

10
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.910 
during a routine checkup when the

11
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.390 
doctor delivered the devastating news

12
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.590 
she had cancer.

13
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.550 
I'm sorry Angelica, you have

14
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.630 
approximately 3 months to live,

15
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.830 
said Doctor Moreno, his voice

16
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.750 
echoing coldly in the room.

17
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.950 
Angelica felt as though her heart had

18
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.030 
been ripped out.

19
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.510 
What about her dreams?

20
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.190 
What would happen to her children,

21
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.240 
Lucas, Sarah and Daniel?

22
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.040 
Worry consumed her, but she decided

23
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.640 
she couldn't let fear rule her

24
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.190 
remaining days.

25
00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.150 
With courage, Angelica called

26
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.590 
her three children, saying, Take

27
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.550 
me to eat wherever I want.

28
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
I want to enjoy my last days.

29
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.790 
She smiled, even though it was

30
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.390 
forced in her mind, a burning

31
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.470 
desire ignited to live every moment to

32
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.790 
the fullest.

33
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.630 
On the weekend, when they arrived

34
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.710 
at the restaurant, Angelica ordered

35
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.000 
a feast.

36
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.240 
Meat, chicken, seafood, and all

37
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.920 
the juices she craved.

38
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.800 
Mom, you can't eat that, it's

39
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.400 
too much.

40
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.510 
Lucas interrupted, concern in

41
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.630 
his eyes.

42
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.950 
I love you son, but please let

43
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.110 
me die in peace.

44
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.310 
I want to enjoy what I have left.

45
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.790 
She replied firmly.

46
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.030 
Then she knelt at the table and prayed.

47
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
Lord, thank you for the life you've

48
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.590 
given me.

49
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.470 
I'm grateful for your love and these

50
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.190 
three months I have left, I will

51
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.190 
use them living fully and helping

52
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.520 
others.

53
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.160 
Days turned into weeks and

54
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.040 
surprisingly.

55
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.710 
Was still alive.

56
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.070 
During those three months she lived her

57
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.470 
best life ever.

58
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.310 
A lot of trips with her children,

59
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.230 
family dinners and laughter.

60
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.470 
Each passing day was a gift.

61
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.070 
On day 91, her children began

62
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.990 
to doubt.

63
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.350 
Really, where's the death that

64
00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.110 
was supposed to come?

65
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.270 
Daniel commented sarcastically.

66
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.110 
Angelica smiled and replied.

67
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.030 
Maybe death got confused and took

68
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.510 
someone else.

69
00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.720 
Seven months later, the family

70
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.320 
gathered for a special dinner to

71
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.110 
celebrate her survival.

72
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.110 
Angelica felt good with renewed energy.

73
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.550 
I feel incredible, she told her

74
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.270 
siblings and children.

75
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.270 
It seems that cancer has forgotten me.

76
00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.150 
After a medical checkup, Dr.

77
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.790 
Valerio was stunned.

78
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.590 
I can't explain it, Angelica,

79
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.230 
but the tests show the cancer is gone,

80
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.950 
she said in amazement.

81
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.350 
Angelica, shocked, looked up at

82
00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.760 
the sky.

83
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.040 
Tears streaming down her face and

84
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.080 
happiness.

85
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.200 
From that day on, her favorite

86
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.240 
song became to God Be the glory,

87
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.550 
her children.

88
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.910 
And their dad, her husband, witnessing

89
00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910 
this miracle, decided to surrender

90
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.030 
to Jesus.

91
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.110 
Grateful for the gift of their mother,

92
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.790 
Angelica's husband, Juan also

93
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.670 
joined them.

94
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.910 
And together they chose to live not

95
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.510 
only for themselves, but to help

96
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.390 
others.

97
00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.070 
Years passed, and Angelica's family

98
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.950 
became a beacon of hope in their

99
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.870 
community.

100
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.270 
They started helping the poor,

101
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.110 
organizing community kitchens and

102
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.190 
donations.

103
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.870 
Angelica, who once feared death,

104
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.470 
now lived with renewed.

105
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.990 
Purpose At a community gathering,

106
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.590 
she shared her story.

107
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:31.950 
Cats are taught me to value.

108
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.870 
Every day I thank God for giving me

109
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.750 
another chance.

110
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.190 
I don't just live for myself,

111
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.390 
but for those who need hope.

112
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.510 
Her children, inspired by her

113
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.110 
example, joined her mission, forming

114
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.030 
a family united by love, faith

115
00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.470 
and generosity.

116
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.200 
Each day was a celebration of life.

117
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.240 
An opportunity to give and share.

118
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.550 
Over time, Angelica's family expanded.

119
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.470 
Grandchildren arrived, filling

120
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.830 
her home with laughter and joy.

121
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.230 
Angelica, now wiser and stronger,

122
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.670 
passed on to her children and

123
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.670 
grandchildren the importance of living

124
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.710 
with purpose and gratitude.

125
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.870 
Living fully doesn't mean having much,

126
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.830 
but giving much.

127
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.150 
She taught them.

128
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.070 
True wealth is found in love and

129
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.790 
generosity.

130
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.310 
Thus, Angelica and her family

131
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.030 
turned their pain into strength,

132
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.750 
becoming a symbol of hope in their

133
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.630 
community living each day.

134
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.950 
As a gift, their story was not

135
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.790 
only a testimony of faith and

136
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.870 
perseverance, but also a lesson

137
00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.470 
in the power of love and the ability to

138
00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.670 
overcome adversity.
