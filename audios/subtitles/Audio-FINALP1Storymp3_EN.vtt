1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.640 
Johnny is walking down the street.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.700 
He just got off work and is going to

3
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.240 
visit a neighbor who is under the weather.

4
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:08.040 
To get to his sick friend's house, he has

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.840 
to cross a dark and lonely alley.

6
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.620 
There have been stories about people

7
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.540 
getting mugged in that very alley.

8
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.440 
Johnny doesn't want to go through there,

9
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.980 
but he promised his wife he'd take the
miracle soup to the ailing old man.

10
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.120 
Johnny finally bites the bullet and goes
through the alley.

11
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.940 
Just as he is about to reach the house,
he is intercepted by a hooded man.

12
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.760 
Johnny starts to sweat bullets.

13
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.960 
The man asks, How are you?

14
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.740 
How is it going?

15
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.600 
Johnny is surprised.

16
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.760 
This is a polite robber, he thinks.

17
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.640 
He responds, Very well, thank God.

18
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.180 
The robber then asks, Where do you live?

19
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.700 
Do you live in that house at the end?

20
00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.440 
Out of fear that the man might think he
is a spy, Johnny says yes.

21
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.680 
The man gives him a beating for lying.

22
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
The man knew Johnny didn't live there.

23
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.800 
This hooded man was the son of the sick
old man.

24
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.380 
He was trying to guard his dad from
scoundrels who would love to rob him.
