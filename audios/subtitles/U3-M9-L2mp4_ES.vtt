ask for prices.

6
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.400 
All right.

7
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.620 
So, first of all, let's hear this audio,
this video over here.

8
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.300 
What's the price?

Once more.

17
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.680 
What's the price?

18
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:32.880 
Excellent.

19
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.400 
So, you could say what's the price of

20
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.580 
this jacket?

21
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.160 
¿Cuál es el precio de esta chaqueta?

22
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.240 
Say it with me.

25
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.620 
Pretty good.

26
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.240 
You could replace this jacket with any
other products.

27
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.660 
Now, for answering how much or what's the
price, para responder, tenemos varias que

28
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.240 
son respuestas que tú ya manejas.

29
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.680 
All right.

30
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.880 
It's y el valor.

31
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.340 
Por ejemplo, it's 21 pounds.

32
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.320 
Dilo conmigo.

33
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.100 
It's 21 pounds.

34
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.000 
Pretty good.

35
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.420 
Now, también podemos decir, this shirt is 15.

36
00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.380 
This shirt is 15.

37
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.640 
Excelente.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.900 
Eso significa que esta camisa es 15.

That's only 19.

43
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.810 
Only significa solo.

44
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.750 
All right.

45
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
That's only 19 pounds.

46
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.630 
Otra forma que puedes decir el precio es

47
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.450 
diciendo, that's 100 altogether, please.

48
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.430 
Dí conmigo.

49
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
That's 100 altogether, please
.

50
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.570 
Once more.

51
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.370 
That's 100 altogether, please.

52
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.470 
That's great.

53
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.950 
That's great.

54
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.550 
Now, let's check this video on the most
expensive things.

55
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.490 
Top 10 most expensive things in the world
.

56
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.350 
Selling here at RM Studies, ladies and
gentlemen, the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO.

57
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.730 
44 million dollars
.

58
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.330 
Well done.

59
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
This vividly pink internally flawless 59

60
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
.60 carat African diamond broke records
in 2017 after selling for 71 million dollars.

61
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.710 
This is the largest fancy vivid pink
internally flawless they've ever graded.

62
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.690 
So I think we're looking at the biggest
pinkest diamond note.

63
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.150 
It was sold at auction in Hong Kong,
destroying the previous record setting

64
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.970 
sale of a diamond of 57 .5 million dollars.

65
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.050 
You know, compared to those prices, the

66
00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
prices here are quite low.

67
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
Dí conmigo.

68
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.890 
The prices here are quite low.

69
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.450 
Pretty good.

70
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.990 
Eso significa los precios aquí son
bastante bajos.

71
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.950 
Por última vez, the prices here are quite low.

72
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.230 
Excellent.

73
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.890 
Now, let's check.

74
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.650 
Si, por ejemplo, los precios no te

75
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.230 
parecen quite low, sino que están high,
bastante altos, then you could say,

76
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.490 
perhaps we can find a better deal at
another store

77
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.810 
.

78
00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.490 
Quizá podamos encontrar una mejor oferta

79
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.390 
en otra tienda.

80
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.130 
Dilo conmigo.

81
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.070 
Perhaps we can find a better deal at
another store.

82
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.730 
Pretty good.

83
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.430 
Once more.

84
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.150 
Perhaps we can find a better deal at
another store.

85
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.530 
Pretty good.

86
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.950 
So a better deal es como un mejor negocio.

87
00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.070 
Alright?

88
00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.730 
Como la mejor oferta.

89
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.230 
Now, what's the best deal
?

90
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.170 
Or which one do you think it's better
from the video we saw of the most

91
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.750 
expensive things
?

92
00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.950 
De ese video que vimos de las cosas bien caras.

93
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.990 
¿Cuál es el better deal?

94
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.740 
Escribilo allá abajo.

95
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.530 
Now, this is a budget.

96
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.030 
Budget es un presupuesto.

97
00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
So dí conmigo, budget.

98
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.050 
That's right.

99
00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.410 
Once more.

100
00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.730 
Budget.

101
00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.990 
Excellent.

102
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670 
Budget es un presupuesto.

103
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.830 
And you can say when something's, you

104
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.110 
know, muy caro para ti.

105
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.010 
Podrías decir como este señor.

106
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.890 
Oh, okay.

107
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.730 
So it's coming out of my budget.

108
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.590 
Oh, okay.

109
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.410 
So it's coming out of my budget.

110
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.870 
Oh, okay.

111
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.830 
So it's coming out of my budget.

112
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.610 
En otras palabras, él está diciendo, oh,
that's out of my budget.

113
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.150 
Oh, eso se sale de mi presupuesto.

114
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.750 
Okay?

115
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.450 
Está fuera de mi presupuesto.

116
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.950 
Dilo conmigo.

117
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.950 
Oh, that's out of my budget.

118
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:31.190 
Pretty good.

119
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.850 
Once more.

120
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.870 
That's out of my budget.

121
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.330 
That's great.

122
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.090 
That's great.

123
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.670 
Now, I got some good news for you.

124
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.830 
Today, we've learned more than 25, 24

And we've also practiced some

127
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.310 
pronunciation, listening, and cultural takeaway.

128
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.990 
Believe in yourself and in your abilities

129
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.990
