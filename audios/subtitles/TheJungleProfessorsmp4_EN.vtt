00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:08.180 
the jungle professors by day professor
lucas and dr maria were beloved

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.320 
university teachers lucas taught zoology
and maria specialized in anthropology

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.180 
they were respected by students and
colleagues alike for their vast knowledge

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.240 
yet once night fell their lives changed
entirely the couple lived deep in the

5
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.040 
jungle in a hidden cabin surrounded by
towering trees and wild animals lucas

6
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.440 
asked maria how often do you think
someone will notice our double life maria

7
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.840 
smiled once in a blue moon maybe who
would ever think that two university

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.620 
professors could live such a savage life
out here every once in a while they'd

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.120 
walk through the dense forest talking
about their day at the university but as

10
00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:01.610 
soon as the sun set they became hunters
they'd go deep into the jungle searching

11
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050 
for animals to kill and make clothing
from it wasn't just any clothing though

12
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.930 
these weren't your typical professors
their outfits were made from the finest

13
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.490 
animal hides fur and feathers these look
snatched lucas would say after crafting a

14
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.910 
new outfit the jungle had its own rules
and they followed them their clothing was

15
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.090 
a flex showing off their jungle skills
one night as they hunted a wild jaguar

16
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:52.480 
lucas pulled maria aside look out it's
coming toward us he said the jaguar lunge

17
00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
but with swift movements lucas took it
down maria panted that was lit we got

18
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.530 
ourselves a new outfit but their secret
wasn't easy to keep what happens if

19
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.210 
someone from the university finds out
maria wondered aloud that would be like

20
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.590 
letting the cat out of the bag lucas said
but don't worry we'll ghost anyone who

21
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:29.250 
gets too close right maria added plus who
would believe us when pigs fly someone

22
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.050 
might think we're out here hunting
animals by night despite their savage

23
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.990 
night lives the couple maintained their
university facade their students would

24
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.250 
never know that their professors dressed
in fine tailored suits during the day

25
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.870 
spent the night weaving jaguar skins into
clothing themselves but every once in a

26
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:57.980 
while maria would notice a student's
suspicious glance brah do they know she'd

27
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:04.300 
ask lucas stop being so shook he'd reply
they're barking up the wrong tree if they

28
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.820 
think we're anything but boring
professors one day maria overheard a

29
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.520 
student asking a colleague excuse me have
you thought about what professors lucas

30
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
and maria do after class the colleague
laughed sorry i didn't catch that are you

31
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:31.320 
serious maria's heart raised but she kept
her cool sorry she said and then thought

32
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.700 
to herself maybe they're just pulling
someone's leg when someone asked how old

33
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.620 
they were lucas would laugh old enough to
know better but young enough to still

34
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.240 
slay at night they lived a double life
flawlessly they hit the books by day and

35
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.480 
hit the jungle by night killing two birds
with one stone maintaining both their

36
00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:02.540 
careers and their wild passions but the
jungle was dangerous one night lucas

37
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.960 
almost bit off more than he could chew
when they faced a ferocious pack of

38
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:32.190 
wolves maria saved the day by using her
knowledge of the jungle to out wheat them

39
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:44.320 
that was close she said maybe we should
call it a day before one of us ends up

40
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:52.060 
kicking the bucket yeah lucas agreed but
hey we'll still be back tomorrow this

41
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.140 
life is too bustin to stop as they sat in
front of their cabin maria turned to

42
00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.320 
lucas is it okay if we take a break
tomorrow i could use a little rest sure

43
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.860 
go ahead lucas replied we've earned it
break a leg out there tomorrow have you

44
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.340 
thought about how we can make this easier
maria suggested maybe we should ask for

45
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.660 
help from our colleagues good idea lucas
said but i hate to think what they would

46
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:32.020 
say if they knew and so the couple
continued their wild dual existence they

47
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.700 
lived for the thrill of the hunt and
loved the challenge of balancing their

48
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.500 
jungle lives with their academic careers
every once in a while they'd spill the

49
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.820 
tea on their adventures to a close friend
but only enough to keep the truth hidden

50
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.000 
after all in front of the classroom they
were just regular teachers but in the

51
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.460 
jungle they were something entirely
different good idea good idea
