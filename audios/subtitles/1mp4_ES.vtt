00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.460 
In a quiet neighborhood, Eduardo's wife
decided to throw a surprise party for

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.360 
Eduardo's mother.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.080 
Meanwhile, Eduardo's son was trying to

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.840 
hide behind Eduardo's house, excited for
the arrival of the guests.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.060 
Mary's book was on the table, but no one
could concentrate on reading because

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.160 
John's car arrived with a loud noise.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.880 
Sophia's dog barked with joy at the sight

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.760 
of all his friends.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.360 
At the party, Emily's house filled with

10
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.480 
laughter, and David's bike became the
star of the day, as everyone wanted to

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.040 
take a ride
.

12
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.120 
Jessica's phone rang several times with
messages from friends who wanted to join

13
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:38.020 
the fun, while Anna's cat watched from
the window, confused by all the commotion.

14
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.520 
In the end, James' son and Charles'
friend proposed a fun idea, to have a

15
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.380 
bike race, which turned out to be the
most anticipated event of the party.

16
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.680 
And so, everyone enjoyed themselves,
celebrating the joy of friendship and family.

17
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.400 
What a great day!
