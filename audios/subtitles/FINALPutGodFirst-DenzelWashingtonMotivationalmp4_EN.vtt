1 .7 grade point average i hope none of
you can relate at a 1 .7 grade point average

7
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.230 
i was sitting in my mother's beauty shop
they still call it beauty shop now what

8
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.970 
they call it yeah i'll sit in the beauty
parlor i was sitting in my mother's

9
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930 
beauty parlor and i'm looking in the
mirror and i see behind me this woman

10
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.770 
under the dryer and every time she looked
up she every time i looked up she was

11
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.970 
looking at me just looking me in the eye
i didn't know who she was

12
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.630 
and i said you know she said somebody
give me a pen give me a pencil i have a

13
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:23.990 
prophecy march 27 1975 she said boy you
are going to travel the world and speak

14
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.150 
to millions of people now mind you i
flunked out of college i'm thinking about

15
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.910 
joining the army i didn't know what i was
going to do and she's telling me i'm

16
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.450 
going to travel the world and speak to
millions of people well i have traveled

17
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.330 
the world and i have spoke to millions of
people but that's not the most important

18
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.450 
thing the success that i had the most
important thing is that what she taught

19
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.530 
me and what she told me that day has
stayed with me since i've been protected

20
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.670 
i've been directed i've been corrected
i've kept god in my life and has kept me

21
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.230 
humble i didn't always stick with him but
he always stuck with me so stick with him

22
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.010 
in everything you do if you think you
want to do what you think i've done then

23
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:25.400 
do what i've done and stick with god
number two fail that's right today's the

24
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.860 
beginning of the rest of your life and it
can be it can be very frightening and

25
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.440 
it's a new world out there it's a mean
world out there and you only live once so

26
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.720 
do what you feel passionate about
passionate about take chances

27
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.960 
professionally don't be afraid to fail
there's an old iq test was nine dots and

28
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.820 
you had to draw five lines with a pencil
within these nine dots without lifting

29
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.040 
the pencil the only way to do it was to
go outside the box so don't be afraid to

30
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.360 
go outside the box don't be afraid to
think outside the box don't be afraid to

31
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:19.800 
fail big to dream big but remember dreams
without goals are just dreams and they

32
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.910 
ultimately fuel disappointment so have
dreams but have goals life goals yearly

33
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.650 
goals monthly goals daily goals i try to
give myself a goal every day sometimes

34
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.240 
it's just to not curse somebody out
simple goals but have goals and

35
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:55.780 
understand that to achieve these goals
you must apply discipline and consistency

36
00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.940 
in order to achieve your goals you must
apply discipline which you have already

37
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
done and consistency every day not just
on tuesday and miss a few days you have

38
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.760 
to work at it every day you have to plan
every day you've heard the saying we

39
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:25.740 
don't plan to fail we fail to plan hard
