Today is a beautiful day, because we're
going to bake loads of cookies.

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.120 
All of these are easy, one -bowl recipes,
and the cookies that result are soft and

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.900 
chewy, just the way I like them.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.460 
As always, you can find the link to the

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.640 
blog post in the description box below
for the full breakdown of the recipes,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.120 
and no more introduction needed.

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.260 
I'm sure you're ready to dive in, as am

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
I, so let's get started.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.180 
We'll start by making these peanut butter

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.760 
and chocolate oatmeal cookies, which take
only 15 minutes to make from start to

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.640 
finish, and use just 7 ingredients with
no added sugar, oil, or flour.

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.960 
For those who use metric measurements,
like grams and milliliters, please note I

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.800 
always include this in my blog post, so
check the links in the description box below.

14
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.500 
Now, this recipe calls for quick oats,
but if, like me, you only have regular

15
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.140 
oats, you can always make your own by
throwing them into a food processor and

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.640 
blend until coarsely chopped.

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.180 
Now, you're just going to want to add the

18
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.340 
bananas to a large bowl and mash until
you achieve a rather fluid consistency,

19
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.140 
then you add the vanilla extract and
peanut butter and mix it all together.

20
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.100 
At this point, you can add the
cranberries, roasted coconut flakes,

21
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.680 
chocolate, and oats, stirring until it's
all well combined.

22
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.040 
The mixture should create about 12
cookies, so you'll first roll it into a

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.620 
ball and then press it down to create a
cookie shape.

24
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.880 
Place it on a cookie tray lined with
baking paper, and you don't need to leave

25
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.840 
so much room between the cookies because
they won't spread.

26
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.000 
Bake it in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit or
180 Celsius for about 10 -12 minutes, or

27
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.380 
until the tops turn golden.

28
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.480 
Remove it from the oven and allow it to

29
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.640 
cool for a couple of minutes before you
transfer it to a cooling rack to cool completely.

30
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.880 
In my opinion, these cookies can hardly
be called dessert in the conventional

31
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300 
sense, in that they're just too wholesome
and make for a wonderful snack that

32
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.980 
anyone will enjoy, kids or adults alike.

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
This is just to show you how soft and

34
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.620 
chewy the cookies are, and they taste so
good, you won't even believe that they're

35
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.400 
so healthy too.

36
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.420 
Alright, moving on to cookie recipe

37
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.200 
number two, blueberry almond breakfast cookies.

38
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.960 
As the recipe name suggests, these

39
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.560 
cookies can make for a quick grab -and
-go breakfast if you really can't find a

40
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.900 
time for a sit -down meal, but I
personally use it more as a snack or dessert.

41
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.860 
Like the previous recipe, these cookies
are made with no added sugar, oil, or

42
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.340 
flour, and feature some super wholesome
ingredients, including antioxidant -rich

43
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.160 
blueberries, fiber, and omega -3
powerhouses like flax and chia seeds, as

44
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.820 
well as applesauce and a banana, which
not only add natural sweetness, but also

45
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.820 
function similarly to oil in baked
treats, but of course, these fruits are

46
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.300 
much more nutritious than oil.
