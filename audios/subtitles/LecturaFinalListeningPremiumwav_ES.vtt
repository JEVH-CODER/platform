00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.600 
In a small town where snow fell softly
each year, everyone looked forward to the

2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.440 
holiday season.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.340 
It was always a time for joy, family, and

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:12.400 
giving, yet this Christmas was going to
be different for Jack.

5
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.460 
He had been working late hours at the
store, preparing for the big party on

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.280 
Christmas Eve.

7
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.000 
Jack had a secret that he was keeping

8
00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.900 
from everyone, he was planning to leave
town tomorrow.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.580 
His friend, Tom, knew something was wrong.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.180 
Jack didn't seem like himself.

11
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.260 
They had been friends for years, and Tom
could always tell when Jack was hiding something.

12
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
I don't think I can stay here, Jack said,
nervously looking out the window.

13
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.820 
There's no point in celebrating this Christmas.

14
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.140 
Tom didn't understand.

15
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:48.580 
Why?

16
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.460 
It's Christmas, time for family, he said,

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.060 
trying to help Jack see the beauty in the season.

18
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.140 
But Jack had already made up his mind.

19
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.760 
That night, when the party started, Jack
felt a strange calm.

20
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.700 
The lights were bright, and everyone was
enjoying the night.

21
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.320 
But he couldn't shake the feeling that
something was missing.

22
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
Suddenly, as the clock struck midnight,
Tom appeared at his side.

23
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.960 
He looked at Jack and said, I know the truth.

24
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.060 
Jack's heart raced.

25
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.480 
Tom reached into his bag and pulled out a letter.

26
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.040 
I found this, he said.

27
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
I know you had planned to leave.

28
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.640 
But you need to stay.

29
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.660 
You're not the only one with secrets
.

30
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.980 
I have been keeping something from you, too.

31
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.020 
Jack was shocked.

32
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.140 
Tom had planned a surprise for him, a
Christmas gift that he had been preparing

33
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.360 
for months, even though Jack didn't think
he needed anything.

34
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.640 
Tom's gift was the last thing Jack ever
expected, a trip to Paris, a place Jack

35
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.340 
had always dreamed of visiting.

36
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.820 
This Christmas, I wanted to show you that

37
00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.260 
sometimes we need each other, even if we
think we're fine on our own.

38
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.260 
Jack smiled, feeling the weight of his
fears disappear.

39
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.680 
He realized that Christmas wasn't about
leaving or being alone.

40
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.280 
It was about love, friendship, and hope.

41
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.440 
And as the night went on, he knew that

42
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.180 
this was the Christmas he would never forget.

43
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
So, that's a fact

44
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.700
