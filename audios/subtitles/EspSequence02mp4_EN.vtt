00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.460 
Once upon a time, on a boat gently moving
under the sun, lived a man named Ben, his

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.300 
wife Sarah and their daughter Lily.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.100 
They had made this boat their home, but

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.760 
it was more than just a place to live.

5
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.480 
It was their jam, inside, behind worn

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.180 
wooden walls.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.440 
They had a small clothes factory.

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.440 
Ben had always wanted to work for
himself, and, well, the boat idea just clicked.

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.020 
It was a risky move, but they took the
chance, and now they were producing the

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080 
most unique, handcrafted clothes.

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.060 
This is where their story begins, where

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.880 
work, family, and secrets weave together
like threads in a fabric.

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.780 
Every day, they moved the boat near small
coastal towns, offering their clothes to

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.600 
curious visitors.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.780 
Who knew you could make a whole factory

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
fit on a boat?

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.020 
People would often say, staring in

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940 
disbelief, Ben always smiled and replied,
Well, when pigs fly, you'll see a factory

19
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.360 
that works harder than this one.

20
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600 
Lily, now 17 years old, had lived on the

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.640 
boat her whole life.

22
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.180 
She knew its creaks, its sounds, and the

23
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.240 
salty air that filled every corner.

24
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.240 
She loved to play on the deck, sometimes

25
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.480 
imagining they were on an adventure in
far -off lands.

26
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.640 
One day, as they finished their last
piece of clothing for the week, Sarah

27
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.820 
called Lily inside.

28
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.800 
Come help me fold these shirts.

29
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.260 
We've got a big order tomorrow.

30
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.020 
How big?

31
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.280 
Lily asked, curious.

32
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.420 
About 500 shirts.

33
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.720 
Her mother replied, her hands moving swiftly.

34
00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.080 
I hope we get it done in time.

35
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.920 
Ben, listening from behind them, sighed,
If we keep cutting corners, we're going

36
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.320 
to have to go back to square one.

37
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
We've already burned the midnight oil

38
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.140 
three times this week.

39
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.140 
Sarah stopped folding and looked at him.

40
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.100 
Don't worry.

41
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.660 
We'll make it work.

42
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.200 
We always do.

43
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
The nights on the boat were quiet, with

44
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.440 
the occasional sound of the waves beneath them.

45
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.220 
But one night, something changed.

46
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.800 
It was a calm evening.

47
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.640 
Lily had just turned off the lights and

48
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.540 
was about to fall asleep when she heard it.

49
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
A soft bump against the side of the boat.

50
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.660 
She sat up, her heart racing.

51
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.600 
Dad?

52
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.920 
She called out softly.

53
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.380 
No answer.

54
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.340 
Cautiously, she tiptoed outside.

55
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.820 
There, near the back of the boat, she saw

56
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.600 
something or someone moving in the shadows.

57
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.000 
Ben exclaimed the next morning, as Lily

58
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.620 
told her parents what she saw.

59
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.180 
I swear, there was someone there.

60
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.920 
I couldn't see them clearly, but I'm not
making this up.

61
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.640 
Lily said.

62
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.660 
Her voice high -key shook.

63
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.380 
Ben and Sarah exchanged worried glances.

64
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.400 
Okay.

65
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.640 
Sarah said calmly.

66
00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.380 
Maybe it's nothing, but we'll keep an eye out.

67
00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.880 
Let's not get salty over it.

68
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.360 
Over the next few days, strange things

69
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.040 
started to happen.

70
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.940 
A batch of shirts, which had been neatly

71
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.220 
folded, appeared out of place.

72
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.360 
Once, they even found a shirt completely

73
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.720 
soaked, despite having left it dry under
the roof.

74
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.700 
Lily would wake up in the middle of the
night, hearing footsteps outside her room.

75
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.380 
This is getting sus.

76
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.540 
She whispered one morning to her dad.

77
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.220 
What do you mean?

78
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.700 
Ben asked, glancing over at Sarah.

79
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.580 
How could there be anyone on board
without us noticing?

80
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.120 
I don't know, but it's vibing way off.

81
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.600 
That afternoon, they decided to search

82
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.840 
every inch of the boat.

83
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.700 
They looked under every shelf, behind

84
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.300 
every curtain, but found nothing, until
Ben opened the storage room door.

85
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.500 
There, inside, hidden behind the boxes of
fabric, they found an old man.

86
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.580 
His clothes were ragged, his face worn by
the sea, and his eyes wide with fear.

87
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.460 
What the?

88
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.420 
Ben muttered, backing up.

89
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.200 
Sarah gasped, and Lily stood frozen.

90
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.400 
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.340 
The old man said, holding up his hands.

92
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.600 
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

93
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.260 
I've just been hiding here for a few days.

94
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.360 
Please, don't kick me out.

95
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.080 
Who are you?

96
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.380 
And what are you doing here?

97
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.980 
Sarah asked her voice firm.

98
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.540 
My name is Tom.

99
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.020 
I used to live in these waters, but I
lost everything.

100
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.140 
I saw your boat, and I thought I could,
you know, hide.

101
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.700 
I didn't want to bother you, I swear.

102
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.560 
Ben was speechless, but Lily felt a

103
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.200 
strange sympathy for the man.

104
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.100 
Dad.

105
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.920 
She whispered, Maybe we could help him.

106
00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.420 
No way.

107
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.520 
Ben replied, shaking his head.

108
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.320 
We're not running a charity here.

109
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:01.780 
But Sarah thought for a moment.

110
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.020 
Why don't you work with us for a while?

111
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.060 
You can help with the clothes, and once
you've earned enough, we'll let you go.

112
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.460 
Tom's eyes lit up.

113
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.200 
I'd be so grateful.

114
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.940 
He said, his voice low -key desperate.

115
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
Weeks passed, and Tom became part of

116
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.480 
their routine.

117
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.680 
He worked hard, sewing and cutting,

118
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.940 
making the most out of what little he had.

119
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.740 
Lily would ask him questions all the time.

120
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.180 
How old are you?

121
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.340 
She asked once.

122
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.580 
Sixty -two.

123
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.340 
He replied, I've been on these waters for

124
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.600 
as long as I can remember.

125
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.520 
But as time went on, more secrets began

126
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.060 
to spill.

127
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.260 
Lily overheard Tom talking to someone on

128
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.480 
the radio late one night.

129
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:49.900 
Could you say that again?

130
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.420 
He whispered from the shadows.

131
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.820 
He repeated something about a shipment,

132
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.060 
about someone coming to take the boat.

133
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.480 
Lily felt her heart skip a beat.

134
00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.400 
She went straight to her parents.

135
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.640 
Tom isn't who he says he is.

136
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.820 
He's planning something, something big.

137
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.620 
I heard him say they're coming for the boat.

138
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.800 
Ben, now suspicious, decided to confront Tom.

139
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.500 
What's really going on here?

140
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.940 
He demanded the next morning.

141
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.140 
Tom, caught off guard, stuttered.

142
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.340 
I didn't want to involve you.

143
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.440 
I owe a lot of people a lot of money.

144
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.840 
They've been chasing me, and I thought,
maybe this boat could save me.

145
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.240 
And now they're coming for us?

146
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.100 
Sarah asked, her voice sharp.

147
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.700 
Tom hung his head.

148
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.540 
Yes.

149
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:41.380 
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.180 
I didn't mean for this to happen.

151
00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.900 
The family had no choice.

152
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.360 
They packed up their things and moved the

153
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.480 
boat further out to sea, hoping to avoid
the danger coming their way.

154
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.160 
But deep down, they knew they were on
thin ice.

155
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.740 
Tom had brought trouble into their lives,
and the question now was, how long could

156
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.460 
they escape it?

157
00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.540 
What is this to say?
