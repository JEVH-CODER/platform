1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.880 
All right, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.480 
Welcome to this class.

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.160 
Today we're going to learn several
important questions that will be very

4
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.840 
useful for you.

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.790 
Let's check out this video.

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.790 
Where's your house?

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.270 
Where's your house?

8
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.750 
Where's your house?

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.190 
So, the men's there saying, where's your house?

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.670 
Ahí está diciendo, where's your house?

11
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.070 
¿Dónde está tu casa?

12
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.630 
Okay, where's.

13
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.010 
Where's es como la contracción de where is.

14
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.590 
Okay, ¿dónde está?

15
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.830 
So, you could also ask, like, where are

16
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.210 
my kids?

17
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.350 
¿Dónde están mis llaves?

18
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.170 
Just in case you lose something, you can
ask, where's my, ¿dónde está mi?

19
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
Y cualquier objeto, cuando se te pierda algo.

20
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.630 
For example, where are my socks?

21
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.330 
Where's my shirt?

22
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.710 
Where's my notebook?

23
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.670 
Where's my pen?

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.310 
All right, todas esas son preguntas que

25
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.890 
puedes hacer.

26
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.890 
Where's, para preguntar dónde está.

27
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.390 
Y una respuesta, por ejemplo, a where's
your house es esta de aquí.

28
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.490 
It's by the park.

29
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.470 
All right, está o queda por el parque.

30
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.150 
It's by the park.

31
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.870 
Dilo conmigo.

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.230 
It's by the park.

33
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.170 
Pretty good.

34
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
It's by the park.

35
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.050 
Excellent.

36
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.730 
Puedes reemplazar park con cualquier lugar.

37
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.810 
Por ejemplo, by the hospital. Or by the

38
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.050 
supermarket. Or by any other place.

39
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.370 
Okay?

40
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.490 
You can just put your place there.

41
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.790 
Puedes reemplazar con tu lugar ahí.

42
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.910 
Next up, let's check over here.

43
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.730 
Para algo más específico, por ejemplo,

44
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.850 
cuando suceden accidentes, te pueden
preguntar la pregunta que acabo de salir.

45
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.910 
Y es, what is your address?

46
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.130 
What's your address?

47
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.650 
What's your address?

48
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.110 
What's your address?

49
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.110 
What's your address?

50
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
What's your address?

51
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.770 
So, dilo conmigo.

52
00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.970 
What is your address?

53
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.890 
Pretty good.

54
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.750 
Once more, what is your address?

55
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.910 
Excellent, excellent.

56
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
Asegúrate de enfatizar en address.

57
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.930 
Okay?

58
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.690 
Address.

59
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.950 
Porque eso te va a servir, por ejemplo,
cuando suceda un accidente, como le están

60
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.050 
preguntando a este señor aquí.

61
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.310 
What's your address?

62
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.790 
What's your address?

63
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.270 
What's your address?

64
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.810 
What is your address?

65
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.950 
¿Cuál es tu dirección?

66
00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:08.390 
Alright?

67
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.890 
Pretty good.

68
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.010 
And then you can just say, my house is on
47 on...

69
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.610 
Y el nombre de la street.

70
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.310 
Street es una calle.

71
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.650 
Alright?

72
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.390 
So, como en esta frase de aquí.

73
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.410 
My house is 47 on ELM Street.

74
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.130 
Okay?

75
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.050 
Mi casa está...

76
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.130 
Es la número 47 en la calle ELM.

77
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.350 
Alright?

78
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.530 
So, dilo conmigo.

79
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.910 
My house is 47 on Elman Street.

80
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.800 
Pretty good.

81
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.300 
Pretty good.

82
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.940 
Now, for example, they could also ask you

83
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
for the temperature.

84
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.800 
También te podrían preguntar por la temperatura.

85
00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.520 
And you could say something like this.

86
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.800 
Podrías decir algo como esto.

87
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.860 
The temperature reached 91 degrees today.

88
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.480 
La temperatura alcanzó los 91 grados hoy.

89
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.060 
Alright?

90
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.700 
Dilo conmigo.

91
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.340 
In English.

92
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.100 
The temperature reached 91 degrees today.

93
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.860 
Pretty good.

94
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.420 
Once more.

95
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.180 
The temperature reached 91 degrees today.

96
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.160 
That's awesome.

97
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.900 
That's awesome.

98
00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.060 
So, now, we're gonna check this video on

99
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.440 
the hottest parts of the world.

100
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.280 
Most people dream of going on holiday to

101
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.660 
a warm country and spending the day
lounging in the sun.

102
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.460 
But beware.

103
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.660 
Some countries may just be a little too

104
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
warm for you.

105
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.480 
Here are 10 countries with the hottest

106
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.380 
temperatures ever recorded.

107
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.020 
Know before you go.

108
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.880 
Number 10.

109
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.540 
Delol, Ethiopia.

110
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.120 
This area is full of hot springs and gas geysers.

111
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:42.020 
Which is probably why during the years

112
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.020 
1960 to 1966, it recorded an average
daily high temperature of 106 Fahrenheit.

113
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.920 
Making it the uninhabited area with the
highest average in the world.

114
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.960 
Number 9.

115
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.660 
Dashilut, Iran.

116
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.920 
Between 2003 and 2009, this desert
plateau reached ground temperatures of

117
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.120 
159 Fahrenheit.

118
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.020 
That's hot enough to melt your car's tires.

119
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.980 
In your city, in your city, the
temperature reached, how many degrees?

120
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:18.680 
Write it down there.

121
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.060 
All right.

122
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.960 
So today we learned more than 28 words
and more than five English expressions.

123
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.740 
We've also practiced pronunciation, some
listening, and some cultural takeaway.

124
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.460 
All right.

125
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.200 
So don't forget this over here.

126
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.420 
Rate the video.

127
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.520 
Dale tus estrellitas aquí al video.

128
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.680 
And also, write a comment down there.

129
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.020 
At least 15 words.

130
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.320 
All right.

131
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.460 
With at least 15 words.

132
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.360 
We've also got here something very important.

133
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.640 
Your efforts today will shape your success.

134
00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:45.400 
Tomorrow.

135
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.680 
Tus esfuerzos de hoy moldearán tu éxito mañana.

136
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.620 
All right.

137
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.080 
So don't forget to keep going ahead.

138
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.140 
Keep going on.

139
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.980 
Keep going forward.

140
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.760 
And don't give out.

141
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.440 
No te rindas.

142
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.660 
See you in the next one.
