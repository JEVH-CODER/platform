00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.020 
Valeria's got a small apartment where she
lives with her family.

2
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.900 
Tonight, they are gathered around the
dinner table for a special meal together.

3
00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
The family likes to talk and bother
Valeria, Carrot.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.740 
Hey Valeria, what do you do now?

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.880 
Asks her Uncle Josh.

6
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.520 
Well, I'm a high school teacher.

7
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.300 
And I've got some amazing students.

8
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.320 
Valeria answers.

9
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.880 
Cool!

10
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.660 
Do you have a boyfriend already?

11
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.180 
Or are you still single?

12
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.200 
Says her Grandpa.

13
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.500 
Oh, come on Grandpa.

14
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.680 
Can you please stop asking those questions?

15
00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:38.880 
Complaints Valeria.

16
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.280 
To be honest, he can't.

17
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.020 
Dad says.

18
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.540 
I think she's still single.

19
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.440 
No man wants to date a teacher.

20
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.820 
She'll be trying to teach him all the time.

21
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.900 
Says her cousin Mark.

22
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.340 
Hey, what about Daniel?

23
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.400 
He's a good man.

24
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.120 
Says her mom.

25
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.240 
He's cool, but he's not interested in me.

26
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.400 
We're just friends.

27
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
Says Valeria.

28
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.660 
Is he a school teacher too?

29
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.500 
Asks Aunt Mary.

30
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.000 
No, he's the school's dean.

31
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.820 
Says Valeria.

32
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.380 
So, do you have a boyfriend?

33
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
Cousin says.

34
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.780 
No, I don't have a boyfriend and I don't
want to have one yet.

35
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.820 
Valeria says.

36
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
And Daniel, does he have a girlfriend?

37
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.500 
Aunt asks.

38
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:37.000 
No, he doesn't have a girlfriend.

39
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.480 
He has a dog and he treats it like a
human being.

40
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.020 
I really can't tolerate it.

41
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.640 
He even brings his dog to the office.

42
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.400 
I fell the other day when I slipped on
the dog's urine.

43
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.760 
Yuck!

44
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.720 
Don't worry about it.

45
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.780 
Just marry him.

46
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.480 
How old is he?

47
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
Oh my gosh.

48
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.580 
You've got to be kidding me.

49
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.080 
I'm going to hit the sack.

50
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.920 
I'm tired of all these questions.

51
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.300 
Valeria is trying to sleep when her phone rings.

52
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.060 
Hello?

53
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.060 
Who is it?

54
00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.020 
Valeria says.

55
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.640 
No answer.

56
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.040 
Hi!

57
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.380 
Who's there?

58
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.560 
Valeria insists.

59
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.600 
Something dark is happening in your family.

60
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.400 
Slowly says an unfamiliar voice.

61
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.660 
What are you talking about?

62
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.680 
Who do you want to speak to?

63
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.680 
Valeria asks, starting to worry.

64
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.620 
Something dark is happening in your family.

65
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.640 
The voice says again.

66
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.760 
I don't understand.

67
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.280 
Why are you telling me that?

68
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.300 
Valeria asks.

69
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.400 
Valeria is in her bedroom trying to
recover from that horror scene when

70
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:52.760 
someone comes into her room.

71
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.200 
The person is agitated and can barely speak.

72
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.760 
Valeria!

73
00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.220 
Your brother's missing!

74
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:00.460 
What?

75
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.020 
Wasn't he out in the backyard a few

76
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.580 
minutes ago?

77
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.400 
He was, but now he isn't.

78
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.280 
Valeria is shocked.

79
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.000 
Valeria is shocked.
