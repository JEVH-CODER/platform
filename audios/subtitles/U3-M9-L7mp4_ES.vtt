1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.880 
All right, guys.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.480 
Welcome to this class.

3
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.160 
Today we're going to learn some very
important questions that will be very

4
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.840 
useful for you.

5
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.790 
Let's check out this video.

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.790 
Where's your house?

7
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.270 
Where's your house?

8
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.730 
Where's your house?

9
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.190 
So, the men's there saying, where's your house?

10
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.670 
Ahí está diciendo, where's your house?

11
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.070 
¿Dónde está tu casa?

12
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.630 
Okay, where's.

13
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.010 
Where's es como la contracción de where is.

14
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.590 
Okay, ¿dónde está?

15
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.830 
So, you could also ask, like, where are

16
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.210 
my kids?

17
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.350 
¿Dónde están mis llaves?

18
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.170 
Just in case you lose something, you can
ask, where's my, ¿dónde está mi?

19
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.650 
Y cualquier objeto, cuando se te pierda algo.

20
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.630 
For example, where are my socks?

21
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.330 
Where's my shirt?

22
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.710 
Where's my notebook?

23
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.670 
Where's my pen?

24
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.310 
All right, todas esas son preguntas que

25
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.890 
puedes hacer.

26
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.890 
Where's, para preguntar dónde está.

27
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.390 
Y una respuesta, por ejemplo, a where's
your house es esta de aquí.

28
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.490 
It's by the park.

29
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.470 
All right, está o queda por el parque.

30
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.130 
It's by the park.

31
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.870 
Dilo conmigo.

32
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.230 
It's by the park.

33
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.170 
Pretty good.

34
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
It's by the park.

35
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.050 
Excellent.

36
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.710 
Puedes reemplazar park con cualquier lugar.

37
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.570 
Por ejemplo, by the hospital.

38
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.470 
Or by the supermarket.

39
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.050 
Or by any other place.

40
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.370 
Okay?

41
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.490 
You can just put your place there.

42
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.790 
Puedes reemplazar con tu lugar ahí.

43
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.910 
Next up, let's check over here.

44
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.750 
Para algo más específico, por ejemplo,
cuando suceden accidentes, te pueden

45
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.890 
preguntar la pregunta que acabo de salir
y es, what is your address?

46
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
So, dilo conmigo.

47
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.950 
What is your address?

48
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.930 
Pretty good.

49
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.830 
Once more, what is your address?

50
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.870 
Excellent, excellent.

51
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.010 
Excellent, excellent.

52
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.510 
Asegúrate de enfatizar en address.

53
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.930 
Okay?

54
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.670 
Address.

55
00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.530 
Porque eso te va a servir, por ejemplo,

56
00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.050 
cuando sucede un accidente, como le están
preguntando a este señor aquí.

57
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.310 
What's your address?

58
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.770 
What's your address?

59
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.270 
What's your address?

60
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:06.790 
What is your address?

61
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.950 
¿Cuál es tu dirección?

62
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.390 
Alright?

63
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.890 
Pretty good.

64
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.330 
And then you can just say, my house is on

65
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.650 
47 on y el nombre de la street.

66
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.310 
Street es una calle.

67
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.630 
Alright?

68
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.190 
So, como en esta frase de aquí, my house

69
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.410 
is 47 on ELM Street.

70
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.110 
Okay?

71
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.870 
Mi casa está, es la número 47 en la calle ELM.

72
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.350 
Alright?

73
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.530 
So, dilo conmigo.

74
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.870 
My house is 47 on ELM Street.

75
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.300 
Pretty good, pretty good.

76
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.940 
Now, for example, they could also ask you

77
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.740 
for the temperature.

78
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.740 
También te podrían preguntar por la temperatura.

79
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.520 
And you could say something like this.

80
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.820 
Podrías decir algo como esto.

81
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.880 
The temperature reached 91 degrees today.

82
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.480 
La temperatura alcanzó los 91 grados hoy.

83
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.060 
Alright?

84
00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.340 
Dilo conmigo, in English.

85
00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.100 
The temperature reached 91 degrees today.

86
00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.420 
Pretty good, once more.

87
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.220 
The temperature reached 91 degrees today.

88
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.160 
That's awesome.

89
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.920 
That's awesome.

90
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.680 
So, now, we're going to check this video

91
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.440 
on the hottest parts of the world.

92
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.280 
Most people dream of going on holiday to

93
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.660 
a warm country and spending the day
lounging in the sun

94
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.920 
.

95
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.260 
But beware, some countries may just be a

96
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.040 
little too warm for you.

97
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.160 
Here are 10 countries with the hottest

98
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.160 
temperatures ever recorded.

99
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.400 
Know before you go

100
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.880 
.

101
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.520 
Number 10.

102
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.800 
Delol, Ethiopia.

103
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.680 
This area is full of hot springs and gas geysers.

104
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.400 
Which is probably why during the years
1960 to 1966, it recorded an average

105
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.140 
daily high temperature of 106 Fahrenheit.

106
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.820 
Making it the uninhabited area with the

107
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.120 
highest average in the world
.

108
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.780 
Number 9.

109
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.880 
Dashilut, Iran.

110
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
Between 2003 and 2009, this desert
plateau reached ground temperatures of

111
00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.160 
159 Fahrenheit
. That's hot enough to melt your car's tires.

112
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.300 
It's in your city, en tu ciudad.

113
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
The temperature reached.

114
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.240 
La temperatura alcanzó.

115
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.680 
How many degrees?

116
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:19.960 
Write it down there.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.880 
All right.

119
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.060 
So, today we learned more than 28 words

120
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.740 
and more than 5 English expressions.

121
00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.200 
We've also practiced pronunciation, some

122
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.940 
listening, and some cultural takeaway.

123
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.660 
All right.

124
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.240 
So, don't forget this over here.

125
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.220 
Rate the video.

126
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.880 
Dale tus estrellitas aquí al video.

129
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.080 
All right.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.440 
With at least 15 words.

131
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
We've also got here something very important.

Your efforts today will shape your

Tus esfuerzos de hoy moldearán tu éxito mañana.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.220 
All right.

135
00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.380 
So, don't forget to keep going ahead.

136
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.580 
Keep going on.

137
00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:56.740 
Keep going forward.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:57.720 
And don't give up.
