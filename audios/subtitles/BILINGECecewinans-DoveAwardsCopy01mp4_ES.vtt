00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.900 
You gotta be kidding me.

2
00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.240 
Um, we've all been focused on giving God

3
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.720 
the glory and, and I'm so grateful for them.

4
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.860 
I'm grateful to my incredible husband of

5
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:55.350 
40 years, even though I'm, I'm stuck with
the name Winans.

6
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.970 
My last name has been love for over 40
years and he has lived up to his name.

7
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.350 
Thank you so much, babe.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.950

9
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.310 
grandchildren, I have three with another
one on the way.

10
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.910 
Amazing.

11
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.870 
Um, to all of you who have played my

12
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.690 
songs and who have come to our concerts,
um, to my family, the Winans, all of my

13
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.350 
brothers and sisters, my mom and dad,
where it all started.

14
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:29.950 
Um, you know, I, I was speaking the other
day and it came to me that all of us, you

15
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:38.570 
know, I was thinking of myself at the
time that I'm known for my music all of

16
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.450 
the world, all over the world, people
know me for my music, right?

17
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.310 
But, but God only knows me for my
relationship with him.

18
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.610 
He only knows us according to the way we
know him.

19
00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:00.370 
Um, and so all of us here tonight as all
of the artists, the artists that I was in

20
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.290 
the categories with, I mean, I just came
to cheer them on tonight.

21
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.290 
I didn't think this was going to happen.

22
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.170 
Um, but, but God is faithful.

23
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.910 
All my life, he's been faithful.

24
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.650 
All my life, he's been good.

25
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:24.730 
With every breath that I'm able, I will
sing of the goodness of God.

26
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.050 
Thank you so much.

27
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.670
