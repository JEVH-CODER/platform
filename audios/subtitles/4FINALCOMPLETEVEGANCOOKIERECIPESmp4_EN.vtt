00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.840 
Today is a beautiful day, because we're
going to bake loads of cookies.

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.120 
All of these are easy, one -bowl recipes,
and the cookies that result are soft and

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.900 
chewy, just the way I like them.

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.460 
As always, you can find the link to the

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.040 
blog post in the description box below
for the full breakdown of the recipes and

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.120 
no more introduction needed.

7
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.260 
I'm sure you're ready to dive in, as am

8
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
I, so let's get started.

9
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.180 
We'll start by making these peanut butter

10
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.760 
and chocolate oatmeal cookies, which take
only 15 minutes to make from start to

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.640 
finish, and use just 7 ingredients with
no added sugar, oil, or flour.

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.960 
For those who use metric measurements,
like grams and milliliters, please note I

13
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.800 
always include this in my blog post, so
check the links in the description box below.

14
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.480 
Now, this recipe calls for quick oats,
but if, like me, you only have regular

15
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.140 
oats, you can always make your own by
throwing them into a food processor and

16
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.640 
blend until coarsely chopped.

17
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.180 
Now, you're just going to want to add the

18
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.340 
bananas to a large bowl and mash until
you achieve a rather fluid consistency,

19
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.140 
then you add the vanilla extract and
peanut butter and mix it all together.

20
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.100 
At this point, you can add the
cranberries, roasted coconut flakes,

21
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.680 
chocolate, and oats, stirring until it's
all well combined.

22
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.040 
The mixture should create about 12
cookies, so you'll first roll it into a

23
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.620 
ball and then press it down to create a
cookie shape.

24
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.880 
Place it on a cookie tray lined with
baking paper, and you don't need to leave

25
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.840 
so much room between the cookies because
they won't spread.

26
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.000 
Bake it in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit or
180 Celsius for about 10 -12 minutes, or

27
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.380 
until the tops turn golden.

28
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.480 
Remove it from the oven and allow it to

29
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.640 
cool for a couple of minutes before you
transfer it to a cooling rack to cool completely.

30
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.880 
In my opinion, these cookies can hardly
be called dessert in the conventional

31
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.300 
sense, in that they're just too wholesome
and make for a wonderful snack that

32
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.980 
anyone will enjoy, kids or adults alike.

33
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.980 
This is just to show you how soft and

34
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.620 
chewy the cookies are, and they taste so
good, you won't even believe that they're

35
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.400 
so healthy too.

36
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.440 
Alright, moving on to cookie recipe

37
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.200 
number two, blueberry almond breakfast cookies.

38
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.960 
As the recipe name suggests, these

39
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.560 
cookies can make for a quick grab -and
-go breakfast if you really can't find a

40
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.900 
time for a sit -down meal, but I
personally use it more as a snack or dessert.

41
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.860 
Like the previous recipe, these cookies
are made with no added sugar, oil, or

42
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.340 
flour, and feature some super wholesome
ingredients, including antioxidant -rich

43
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
blueberries, fiber, and omega -3
powerhouses like flax and chia seeds, as

44
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.820 
well as applesauce and a banana, which
not only add natural sweetness, but also

45
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.780 
function similarly to oil in baked
treats, but of course, these fruits are

46
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.320 
much more nutritious than oil.

47
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.520 
Now we're going to create our own almond

48
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.860 
meal by grinding up the almonds in a food
processor until it makes a coarse flour.

49
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.060 
Then we're going to chop some dairy -free
dark chocolate, and if you're not a fan

50
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.620 
of chocolate, you can always substitute
it out in any of these recipes for nuts,

51
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.940 
seeds, or dried fruits of your choosing.

52
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.080 
We'll start again with the banana,

53
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.100 
mashing it completely before we add the
applesauce, almond butter, and vanilla

54
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.900 
extract, then stir to combine.

55
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.560 
Then you can add the almond meal, ground

56
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.460 
flax seeds, and chia seeds, stirring
before you then add the baking soda,

57
00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.740 
cinnamon, and salt.

58
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.140 
Then you'll add the oats and pumpkin

59
00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.800 
seeds, stirring once again before you add
the chocolate and blueberries at the very end.

60
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.120 
You're going to want to fold these in
gently so that the blueberries don't

61
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.660 
bleed so much into the dough.

62
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.980 
Much like before, we're going to roll

63
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.760 
this dough into a ball and then press it
into a cookie shape.

64
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.960 
This should make about 10 cookies in total.

65
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.750 
Always reserve a few chunks of chocolate

66
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.890 
to place on top as well for presentation
before you bake it in the oven at 350

67
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.790 
Fahrenheit or 180 Celsius for about 15
minutes or until it's lightly golden.

68
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.950 
Then allow it to cool for a couple
minutes before you again transfer it to a

69
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.550 
cooling rack.

70
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.910 
These cookies are so delicious, it's

71
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.070 
really just a bonus that they're loaded
with grains, seeds, nuts, and fruit.

72
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.650 
I especially like to enjoy it with some
homemade chai tea and fresh fruit when my

73
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.490 
sweet tooth strikes.

74
00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.250 
And I can say with all honesty, I now

75
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.650 
prefer these to the super sweet
conventional store -bought cookies I used

76
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.350 
to eat before.

77
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.990 
I used to eat them because they were

78
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.950 
convenient, but these cookies can be too.

79
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.050 
I mean, I usually make a big batch and

80
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.450 
then individually wrap them and freeze
them to enjoy as on -demand desserts or

81
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.430 
grab -and -go snacks.

82
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.230 
We're going to move on to our final

83
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.590 
recipe now, classic chocolate chip cookies.

84
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.930 
Now, the previous two recipes were super

85
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.110 
wholesome, but I'm not averse to having
some more indulgent treats sometimes too.

86
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.270 
And this recipe makes for a wonderful
housewarming or potluck contribution if

87
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.830 
you choose.

88
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.550 
I once took it to Robin's family

89
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.850 
gathering and no one noticed they were vegan.

90
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.210 
No hidden or strange ingredients in this

91
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.130 
recipe, and here's a little tip.

92
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.170 
You'll want to use refined coconut oil

93
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.210 
instead of unrefined oil to avoid any
pronounced coconut flavor in the cookies.

94
00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.950 
The coconut oil really just functions
similarly to butter in normal cookie recipes.

95
00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.130 
Another tip is to reserve some of the
chocolate bits for presentation on top of

96
00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.190 
the cookies at the end.

97
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.890 
You'll notice I did this with every

98
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.990 
recipe in this video.

99
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.010 
Now, to a large bowl, you'll want to

100
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.550 
cream together some solid coconut oil and
brown sugar.

101
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.650 
If the coconut oil is liquid, just place
it in the fridge for a bit to harden first.

102
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.630 
Once creamed, add the maple syrup, plant
milk, vanilla extract, baking soda, salt,

103
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.790 
and baking powder, and mix it again until
well combined.

104
00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.990 
The mixture is going to look clumpy, and
that's okay.

105
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.990 
Now, if the temperature is warm where you
are, you might want to consider chilling

106
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.610 
this mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes
to firm up.

107
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.650 
Otherwise, the cookies flatten and spread
a little bit too much when it's baking in

108
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.090 
the oven.

109
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.310 
But if the temperature is cool in your

110
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.790 
working space, you can just omit this step.

111
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.770 
Then mix it together one more time before

112
00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.790 
you add the flour, and stir until it's
just combined, but be careful not to overmix.

113
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.890 
Then you can add the chocolate chunks and
gently fold it in.

114
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.890 
Now we're going to form little balls out
of the dough and evenly distribute them

115
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.850 
about 5 centimeters or 2 inches apart
because the cookies will certainly spread

116
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.590 
when it's baking.

117
00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.710 
Top it with the reserved chocolate chunks

118
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.430 
before you bake it in the oven at 350
Fahrenheit or 180 Celsius for 12 to 15

119
00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.070 
minutes or until it's lightly golden.

120
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.350 
The recipe is going to make about 18 to

121
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.750 
20 cookies altogether.

122
00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.810 
Enjoy it with coffee, tea, chai, or

123
00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:00.890 
simply on its own.

124
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.950 
Sometimes a good old classic will hit the

125
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.090 
spot and it's always rewarding to know
you made it yourself from plant -based ingredients.

126
00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.430 
I'll again show you how the cookie comes
apart when it's been cooled, the texture

127
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.470 
is soft, and the flavor is oh so indulgent.
