00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.700 
It doesn't have to be easy, just worth it.

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.340 
It doesn't have to be easy, if it's gonna

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.960 
work, it has to be easy, it has to be easy.

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.640 
I try to guard you off from that bad

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.620 
idea, guard you off.

6
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.380 
What you were telling me really helped,

7
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.740 
what you were telling me.

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.640 
That new phone is a total game changer,

9
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.520 
game changer.

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.640 
What they wanna say doesn't matter to me.

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.080 
What they wanna say.

12
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.540 
He intentionally ignored the

13
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.180 
instructions, intentionally.

14
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.760 
If I get discouraged, I'll just take a break.

15
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.000 
If I get discouraged, the only thing you
need to do is start now.

16
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.280 
The only thing you need to do.

17
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.480 
Come on, it's not rocket science.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.120 
It's not rocket science.

19
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.140 
Have I ever told you I like your food?

20
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.820 
Have I ever told you I like your food?

21
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.120 
What do you keep cooking for me every day?

22
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.740 
What do you keep cooking for me?

23
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.320 
Let's get this done now.

24
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.620 
The faster the better.

25
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.180 
The faster the better.

26
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.420 
The more she spoke, the more she cried.

27
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.720 
The more she spoke, the more she cried.

28
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.300 
I could feel they were proud of us at the event.

29
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.040 
I could feel they were proud of us.

30
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.140 
That's the most important part of it all.

31
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.840 
You have to stay focused.

32
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.180 
Of it all.

33
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.560 
I'm really tired of it, but I know I need

34
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:44.260 
to keep going.

35
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.240 
Of it.

36
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.640 
You oughta have called me before making
any decisions about this.

37
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.880 
Oughta.

38
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.340 
I gotta finish this report by the end of

39
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.820 
the day or we're in trouble.

40
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.700 
Gotta.

41
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
I'm kinda nervous about this presentation
because I want it to be perfect.

42
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.340 
Kind of.

43
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.500 
Would you mind helping me with these calculations?

44
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.920 
I'm having a hard time.

45
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:15.580 
Would you?

46
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.400 
Could you explain to me how this machine works?

47
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.140 
I've never used it before.

48
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.180 
Could you?

49
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.200 
You should have told me about your plans

50
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.800 
earlier so I could have prepared.

51
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.120 
Should've.

52
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.940 
I really want to go on vacation next
month, but I have so much work to do.

53
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.220 
Want to.

54
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.780 
I have to get up early tomorrow to catch

55
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.020 
the flight so I can't stay out too late.

56
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.460 
Have to.

57
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.160 
Let me take a look at that document
before you send it to the client.

58
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.320 
Let me.

59
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.680 
Give me a few minutes and I'll have the

60
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.960 
answers you're looking for.

61
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.220 
Give me.

62
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.060 
I want a new laptop, but I don't know if
I can afford one right now.

63
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.800 
Wanna.

64
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.420 
Did you check the latest numbers on the report?

65
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.720 
We need them for the meeting.

66
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.420 
Give me a second.

67
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.640 
Did you?

68
00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.900 
I gotta go before it gets too late.

69
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.060 
I gotta go.

70
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.520 
What do you do to my phone?

71
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.280 
What do you do?

72
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.520 
I'm gonna do it right now.

73
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.560 
I'm gonna do it.

74
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.500 
Don't you know it's already finished?

75
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:32.640 
Don't you know?

76
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.560 
I don't know.

77
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.100 
I don't know what he wants.

78
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.920 
I don't know.

79
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.980 
Give me a second.

80
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.600 
I'm coming.

81
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.500 
Give me a second.

82
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:44.080 
Let me see if I can fix it.

83
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.760 
Let me see.

84
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.040 
Should I get the tickets for the concert?

85
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:50.240 
Do you get it?

86
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.360 
What you doing over there?

87
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.040 
What you doing?

88
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.980 
I should have told you earlier.

89
00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.100 
I should have told you.

90
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.340 
I would have gone to the concert if I had

91
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.300 
known about it.

92
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.040 
Woulda.

93
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.240 
You could have asked for help if you were struggling.

94
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.920 
Coulda.

95
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.160 
I should have brought an umbrella.

96
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.520 
It's raining now.

97
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.260 
It's raining now.

98
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.400 
Shoulda.

99
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.680 
Ain't nobody got time for that nonsense.

100
00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:21.620 
Ain't nobody got time for that.

101
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.940 
You want some pizza or not?

102
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.000 
You want some?

103
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.920 
It's kinda weird that he didn't show up.

104
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.960 
It's kinda weird.

105
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.020 
What are you up to this weekend?

106
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.980 
What are you up to?

107
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.140 
I would have done it if I had more time.

108
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.300 
I would have done it.

109
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.560 
He might have left early.

110
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.420 
I didn't see him.

111
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.140 
He might have left early.

112
00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:48.120 
I can't do it anymore.

113
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.040 
I'm too tired.

114
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.480 
I can't do it anymore.

115
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.420 
What are we gonna do about this situation?

116
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
What are we gonna do?

117
00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.300 
You shouldn't have bought that for me.

118
00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.140 
You shouldn't have.

119
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.280 
Where'd you go after the meeting?

120
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:05.400 
Where'd you go?

121
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.980 
I wanna see you before you leave.

122
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.860 
I wanna see you.

123
00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.920 
I couldn't care less about their opinion.

124
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.000 
I couldn't care less.

125
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.020 
She's gonna make it despite the obstacles.

126
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.360 
She's gonna make it.

127
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.200 
Have I ever told you I like your food as
much as my mom's?

128
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.060 
Have I ever told you I like your food?

129
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.140 
What do you keep cooking for me when I've

130
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.240 
never cooked for you?

131
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.000 
What do you keep cooking for me?

132
00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.820 
What are you trying to tell me with all
these hints and comments?

133
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.260 
What are you trying to tell me exactly?

134
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.820 
Did you really think I wouldn't notice

135
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.880 
that you left early?

136
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.440 
Do you really think I wouldn't notice?

137
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.320 
Why haven't you said anything until now
about how you really feel?

138
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.940 
Why haven't you said anything until now?

139
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.120 
Isn't it obvious what you need to do to

140
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.940 
solve this problem?

141
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.720 
Isn't it obvious what you need to do?

142
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.560 
What made you think this was a good idea
without asking anyone first?

143
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.380 
What made you think this was a good idea?

144
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.320 
How could you forget something so

145
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.600 
important when I reminded you yesterday?

146
00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.140 
How could you forget something so important?

147
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.320 
Why would I lie about something like that
when you already know the truth?

148
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.720 
Why would I lie about something like that?

149
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.600 
What do you think I'm supposed to say

150
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.880 
after hearing all of this?

151
00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.080 
What do you think I'm supposed to say?

152
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.840 
How am I supposed to figure this out
alone without any instructions?

153
00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.320 
How am I supposed to figure this out alone?

154
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.640 
Do you think it's gonna get any easier if

155
00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.940 
we don't try something different?

156
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.940 
Do you think it's gonna get any easier?

157
00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.680 
How long have you been waiting for this
opportunity to finally come along?

158
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.460 
How long have you been waiting for this?

159
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.360 
Why don't you just tell me what's grown

160
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.280 
instead of pretending everything is fine?

161
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.120 
Why don't you just tell me what's grown?

162
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.600 
Didn't you say you were gonna fix this
before the deadline?

163
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:18.540 
Didn't you say you were gonna fix this?

164
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.140 
A�. . .

165
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 
Thank you.
