00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.340 
Robots are becoming more and more like humans.

2
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.300 
They can build cars, clean your house,

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
and even do parkour.

4
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.080 
But in this video, I'm cooking against

5
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.700 
three levels of robots to find out who's
the better chef.

6
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.000 
Robots or humans.

7
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.480 
For level one, Mark Rober will be the judge.

8
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.480 
We're gonna see if Nick can beat some of
the most basic kitchen robots that money

9
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.060 
can buy.

10
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.580 
In level one, we'll have five speed rounds.

11
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.140 
Chopping, stirring, toasting, pizza
making, and cleaning.

12
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.740 
And to win, it's a classic best three out
of five.

13
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.200 
Are you team robot or team Nick?

14
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.080 
I mean, of course, I am team robot.

15
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.220 
For this first mini round, we'll be
testing chopping skills.

16
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.500 
And in the robot corner, we've got the RoboCoo.

17
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.920 
It's basically an extremely powerful food

18
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.440 
processor with a couple of googly eyes to boot.

19
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.360 
I like putting googly eyes on my robots.

20
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.120 
Are you ready, Nick?

21
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.860 
Let's do this.

22
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.360 
Start.

23
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.840 
Now?

24
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.460 
That said start.

25
00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.920 
Yeah, I'm taking my time.

26
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.480 
I'm not worried.

27
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.680 
Oh.

28
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.060 
How many do you want me to put in, Nick?

29
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.180 
I mean, you're team robot.

30
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.820 
That's true.

31
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.240 
That feels like a good start.

32
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.560 
Oh, no.

33
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.640 
That was so fast.
