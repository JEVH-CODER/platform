00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000 
Young Fernando sat in the back of the
church, listening to the pastor speak

2
00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.540 
about the need for missionaries.

3
00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.600 
His heart ate as he thought about how he

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.660 
couldn't travel due to a critical illness.

5
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.680 
The pastor then said, you can be a

6
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.280 
missionary in your own neighborhood.

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.120 
This resonated deeply with Fernando.

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.320 
He decided to start handing out Bibles
and talking to people about Jesus.

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.040 
On his first day, he went to buy Bibles.

10
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.020 
At the counter stood a girl named Sarah,

11
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.380 
who seemed enchanting.

12
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.340 
Her devotion was evident as she helped

13
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.940 
customers with a warm smile.

14
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.520 
Every day, Fernando returned to buy more

15
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.300 
Bibles, but he lacked the courage to
speak to her.

16
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.200 
Days turned into weeks, and one evening,
Sarah came home to find her unbelieving

17
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.360 
mother reading a Bible.

18
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.080 
It was one that had been gifted by the

19
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
young man who always bought Bibles.

20
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.720 
Curious, Sarah asked her mother about it.

21
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.200 
He seems like a good person, her mother replied.

22
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.860 
Shortly after, Sarah's mother decided to

23
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.460 
be baptized.

24
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.480 
Excited, they went to Fernando's house to

25
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.820 
invite him to the ceremony.

26
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.160 
However, when Fernando's mother opened

27
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.620 
the door, she shared some sad news, my
son passed away this morning.

28
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
The word struck like lightning.

29
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.000 
But before he died, he said, I know God's

30
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.680 
work through me will bring someone to him.

31
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.020 
Sarah was devastated, but realized that

32
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.860 
Fernando's efforts had indeed touched her
mother's heart.

33
00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.160 
She understood that even in death,
Fernando had accomplished something significant.

34
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.100 
In the end, Fernando's mission continued
through Sarah and her mother.

35
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.960 
They spread his message of faith and love
in their community, ensuring that his

36
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.760 
spirit lived on through their actions.
