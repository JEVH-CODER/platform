00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.640 
In a small town where snow fell softly
each year, everyone looked forward to the

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.500 
holiday season.

3
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.380 
It was always a time for joy, family, and

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.440 
giving, yet this Christmas was going to
be different for Jack.

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.500 
He had been working late hours at the
store, preparing for the big party on

6
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.320 
Christmas Eve.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.020 
Jack had a secret that he was keeping

8
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.960 
from everyone, he was planning to leave
town tomorrow.

9
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.640 
His friend, Tom, knew something was wrong.

10
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.280 
Jack didn't seem like himself.

11
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
They had been friends for years, and Tom
could always tell when Jack was hiding something.

12
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.400 
I don't think I can stay here, Jack said,
nervously looking out the window.

13
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.740 
There's no point in celebrating this Christmas.

14
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.220 
Tom didn't understand.

15
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.600 
Why?

16
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.140 
It's Christmas, a time for family, he

17
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.100 
said, trying to help Jack see the beauty
in the season.

18
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.200 
But Jack had already made up his mind.

19
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.600 
That night, when the party started, Jack

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.860 
felt a strange calm.

21
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
The lights were bright, and everyone was

22
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.720 
enjoying the night.

23
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.400 
But he couldn't shake the feeling that

24
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.380 
something was missing.

25
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.560 
Suddenly, as the clock struck midnight,

26
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.360 
Tom appeared at his side.

27
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.040 
He looked at Jack and said, I know the truth.

28
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.080 
Jack's heart raced.

29
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.480 
Tom reached into his bag and pulled out a letter.

30
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.080 
I found this, he said.

31
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
I know you had planned to leave.

32
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.660 
But you need to stay.

33
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
You're not the only one with secrets.

34
00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.600 
I have been keeping something from you, too.

35
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
Jack was shocked.

36
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.860 
Tom had planned a surprise for him, a
Christmas gift that he had been preparing

37
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.020 
for months, even though Jack didn't think
he needed anything.

38
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.480 
Tom's gift was the last thing Jack ever
expected, a trip to Paris, a place Jack

39
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.040 
had always dreamed of visiting.

40
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.340 
This Christmas, I wanted to show you that

41
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.020 
sometimes we need each other, even if we
think we're fine on our own.

42
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.040 
Jack smiled, feeling the weight of his
fears disappear.

43
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.540 
He realized that Christmas wasn't about
leaving or being alone.

44
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.160 
It was about love, friendship, and hope.

45
00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.240 
And as the night went on, he knew that

46
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.280 
this was the Christmas he would never forget.
