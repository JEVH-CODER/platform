00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.120 
This is Warren Buffett, one of the
richest people in the world, thanks to

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.000 
the company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway.

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.440 
Basically, it's a holding company that

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.300 
just owns a bunch of other companies,
Geico, Dairy Queen, a huge railroad, as

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.920 
well as a lot of stock in other
companies, like Apple and Coca -Cola.

6
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.760 
So when those companies do well and their
stock goes up, Berkshire Hathaway stock

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.140 
goes up.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
When Buffett took over the company in

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.120 
1965, a single share was worth $19.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.980 
Today, it's worth nearly half a million dollars.

11
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.640 
Buffett owns nearly 240 ,000 of these shares.

12
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.120 
This is where his wealth is.

13
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.320 
But as he's been known for pointing out,
Warren Buffett still pays a lower tax

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.400 
rate than his secretary.

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.280 
She pays at twice the rate I pay.

16
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.860 
I think that's outrageous.

17
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.100 
That's because they pay different types

18
00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.680 
of taxes.

19
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.420 
His secretary pays income taxes on her

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.160 
salary, but Buffett mainly pays capital
gains taxes on his sold stock.

21
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.700 
And that's taxed at nearly half the rate.

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.200 
The wealthy are definitely under -taxed.

23
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.580 
In the US, the disparity between the
richest Americans and everyone else has

24
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.080 
been growing.

25
00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.140 
And in the last 40 years, the after -tax

26
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.540 
income of the richest has risen more than
400%, while middle -class income has only

27
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.180 
risen 50%.

28
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.500 
The way these people make money is very

29
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.620 
different than the way these people make money.

30
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.060 
And they're not taxed the same.

31
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.430 
I pay less in taxes than people that work
for a living and make as much money as I do.

32
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.390 
This is Morris.

33
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.910 
He used to work on Wall Street.

34
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.250 
Now, he's retired and lives off his many
stock market investments.

35
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.090 
I own stock in companies like Berkshire
Hathaway and Amazon and Apple.

36
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.050 
He's a pretty typical 1 -percenter,
except that he spends his money

37
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.190 
advocating for rich people like him to be
taxed more.

38
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.110 
I want to live in a country filled with a
middle class of people who can all afford

39
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.790 
to shop in our businesses.

40
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.530 
Most people have a normal job.

41
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.430 
They get a paycheck and pay income tax,
ranging from 10 % to 37%.

42
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.630 
But people like Morris, they make a lot
of their income from investments,

43
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.750 
generally stocks in real estate.

44
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.570 
These investments are taxed as capital

45
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.310 
gains, and things like long -term stock
have a maximum tax rate of just 20%.

46
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.570 
I sold some stock recently for $400 ,000,
and my taxes on that are around $50 ,000.

47
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.350 
But that $50 ,000 is far less tax than
anyone who has a job making $400 ,000 a

48
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.950 
year would pay.

49
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.350 
And most of his wealth, well, isn't even taxable.

50
00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.390 
People like Morris or Buffett are worth
so much money because of the stock that

51
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.390 
they hold, but it's not tangible,
spendable, taxable money.

52
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.670 
I can look at my stock portfolio and say,
oh, you know, I made $1 million this year.

53
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.450 
But it doesn't have to be anything in
taxes, because our system is based on

54
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.810 
only paying taxes when you actually sell something.
