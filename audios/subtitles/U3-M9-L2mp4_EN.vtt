00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:01.460 
Hi there.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.120 
Welcome back to another class.

4
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.640 
Today we're going to check how you can

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.000 
ask for prices.

6
00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.400 
All right.

7
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.620 
So, first of all, let's hear this audio,
this video over here.

8
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.300

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.440 
What's the price?

10
00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.580 
What's the price?

11
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.000 
So, what he's saying there is what's the price?

12
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.500 
What's the price?

13
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.620 
¿Cuál es el precio?

What's the price?

16
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.360 
Pretty good.

17
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.940 
Once more.

18
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.280 
What's the price?

19
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.360 
Excellent.

20
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.420 
So, you could say what's the price of
this jacket?

21
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.640 
¿Cuál es el precio de esta chaqueta?

22
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.460 
Say it with me.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.340 
What's the price of this jacket?

24
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.860 
Pretty good.

25
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.280 
You could replace this jacket with any
other products.

26
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.320 
Now, for answering how much or what's the
price, para responder, tenemos varias que

27
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.380 
son respuestas que tú ya manejas.

28
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.740 
All right.

29
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
It's y el valor.

30
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.220 
Por ejemplo, it's 21 pounds.

31
00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.980 
Dilo conmigo.

32
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.320 
It's 21 pounds.

33
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.840 
Pretty good.

34
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.320 
Now, también podemos decir this shirt is 15.

35
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.960 
This shirt is 15.

36
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.640 
Excelente.

37
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.900 
Eso significa que esta camisa es 15.

38
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.420 
Puedes cambiar shirt por cualquier otro producto.

39
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.000 
También tenemos la tercera que es that's
only 19 pounds.

40
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.470 
Pretty good.

41
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
That's only 19.

42
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.830 
Only significa solo.

43
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.230 
All right.

44
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.490 
That's only 19 pounds.

45
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.110 
Otra forma que puedes decir el precio es

46
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.970 
diciendo, That's a hundred altogether, please.

47
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.970 
Dilo conmigo.

48
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.970 
That's a hundred altogether, please.

49
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.390 
Once more.

50
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.550 
That's a hundred altogether, please.

51
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.730 
That's great.

52
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.350 
That's great.

53
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.950 
Now, let's check this video on the most

54
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.910 
expensive things.

55
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.930 
Top 10 most expensive things in the world.

56
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.730 
Selling here at RM Studies, ladies and
gentlemen, the 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO, $44 million.

57
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.370 
Well done.

58
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.330 
This vividly pink internally flawless 59

59
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.870 
.60 carat African diamond broke records
in 2017 after selling for $71 million.

60
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.230 
This is the largest fancy vivid pink
internally flawless they've ever graded.

61
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.730 
So I think we're looking at the biggest
pinkest diamond known.

62
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.470 
It was sold at auction in Hong Kong,
destroying the previous record setting

63
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.190 
sale of a diamond of $57 .5 million.

64
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.570 
You know, compared to those prices, the

65
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.390 
prices here are quite low.

66
00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.370 
Dilo conmigo.

67
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.090 
The prices here are quite low.

68
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.370 
Pretty good.

69
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.690 
Eso significa los precios aquí son
bastante bajos.

70
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.030 
Por última vez, the prices here are quite low.

71
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.470 
Excellent.

72
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
Now, let's check.

73
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.050 
Si, por ejemplo, los precios no te

74
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.210 
parecen quite low, sino que están high,
bastante altos, then you could say,

75
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.870 
perhaps we can find a better deal at
another store.

76
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.470 
Quizá podamos encontrar una mejor oferta
en otra tienda.

77
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.410 
Dilo conmigo.

78
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.690 
Perhaps we can find a better deal at

79
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.750 
another store.

80
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.690 
Pretty good.

81
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.450 
Once more.

82
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.490 
So a better deal es como un mejor negocio.

83
00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.890 
Alright?

84
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
Como la mejor oferta.

85
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.830 
Now, what's the best deal?

86
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.230 
Or which one do you think it's better

87
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.710 
from the video we saw of the most
expensive things?

88
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.150 
De ese video que vimos de las cosas bien caras.

89
00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.510 
¿Cuál es el better deal?

90
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.170 
Escribilo allá abajo.

91
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.270 
Now, this is a budget.

92
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.730 
Budget es un presupuesto.

93
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.350 
So, di conmigo.

94
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.850 
Budget.

95
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.690 
That's right.

96
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.310 
Once more.

97
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:54.010 
Budget.

98
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.410 
Excellent.

99
00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.670 
Budget es un presupuesto.

100
00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.370 
And you can say when something's, you
know, muy caro para ti, podrías decir

101
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.070 
como este señor.

102
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.190 
Oh, okay.

103
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.030 
So it's coming out of my budget.

104
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.890 
Oh, okay.

105
00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.730 
So it's coming out of my budget.

106
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.590 
Oh, okay.

107
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.410 
So it's coming out of my budget.

108
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
Oh, okay.

109
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.750 
So it's coming out of my budget.

110
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.690 
Pretty good.

111
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.190 
Once more.

112
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.970 
That's out of my budget.

113
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.190 
That's great.

114
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.850 
That's great.

115
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.590 
Now, I got some good news for you.

116
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.430

118
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.290 
pronunciation, listening, and cultural takeaway.

119
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.350 
Believe in yourself and in your abilities

120
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.930 
because Choco Inglés believes in you.

All right.

Don't forget to practice in Anki,
practice in the platform, and also listen

126

128
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.950 
All right.

129
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.830 
That's been all for today.

130
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.690 
See you in the next one.
