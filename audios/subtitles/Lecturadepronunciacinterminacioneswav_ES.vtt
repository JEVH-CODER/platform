00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.880 
Sam woke up early to help his mother with breakfast.

2
00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.760 
Are you feeling in good health today?

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.440 
She asked.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.480 
He nodded, though he felt a bit hot.

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.080 
After breakfast, he said.

6
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.600 
I'll pack my bag and go for a run.

7
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.520 
It's important to stay fit, not fat.

8
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.660 
As he ran, Sam noticed the changing weather.

9
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.920 
There was a chance of rain or even hail,
but he thought.

10
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.660 
I'll keep going.

11
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.760 
He saw a hen in the sand by the path, and

12
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.280 
a bird in the air, singing a song that
made him feel happy.

13
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.040 
Sam stopped by the river, where he saw a
man build a small boat.

14
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680 
I'd build many boats like this, the man said.

15
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
Sam admired his strength and faith in his craft.

16
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.060 
Later, at school, the teacher said.

17
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.640 
Think about what makes life worth living.

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
Is it truth, wealth, or growth?

19
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.520 
Sam raised his hand and said.

20
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
For me, it's my brother, my father, and
my mother.

21
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.440 
They're always there, no matter the month
or the weather.

22
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.920 
In class, they read about the Earth's
history and the death and birth of civilizations.

23
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.580 
Sam learned how strength and determination
can change the world.

24
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.160 
After school, he met his friends and said.

25
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.560 
Hey, let's play soccer.

26
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.480 
They all agreed.

27
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.600 
Who will be the goalkeeper?

28
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.440 
Someone asked.

29
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.000 
I will.

30
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.100 
Sam said.

31
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.400 
He held his position well, showing his

32
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.260 
quick reflexes and strong faith in his team.

33
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.280 
That evening, at dinner, Sam's mother asked.

34
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.440 
What did you learn today?

35
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.160 
He replied.

36
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.180 
We learned about the truth of the world,
and how important it is to work together

37
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.440 
to make it a better place.

38
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.480 
And he told me I am...

39
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.520 
I am 31 years old.

40
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
I can't believe that without my parentsÐµÑ‡é€²icates.

41
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.840 
I would like to present the truth of my podcast.

42
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.900 
I am 30 to 32 years old.

43
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
I have 26 and 35 years old.

44
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.960 
I have out of store as always.

45
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.020 
And I am 31 years old.
