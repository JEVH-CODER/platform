1
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.980 
Right there, right there.

2
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.370 
I love McDonald's.

3
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.290 
I love jobs.

4
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.410 
I like to see good jobs and I think it's

5
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.010 
inappropriate when somebody puts down all
over the place that she worked at McDonald's.

6
00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.050 
It was a big part of her resume that she
worked at McDonald's, how tough a job it was.

7
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.770 
She specifically worked at the French fry
where they make the French fries and she

8
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.730 
talked about the heat.

9
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.610 
It was so tough.

10
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.290 
She never worked at McDonald's.

11
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.030 
Keep it tight.

12
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.030 
You got the salt on it.

13
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.940 
Never touches the human hand.

14
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.560 
Nice and full.
