00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:04.800 
Hello, hello!

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.080 
Welcome to this new lesson!

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.840 
Talking on family.

4
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.220 
So, for today, the first phrase is I have

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.940 
about 10 cousins.

6
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.040 
I have about 10 cousins.

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.860 
You?

8
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.160 
Nice, nice.

9
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.740 
Once again, I have about 10 cousins.

10
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.600 
Cousins.

11
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.360 
Cousins.

12
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.370 
Pretty good.

13
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.690 
Nice.

14
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.770 
So, about can also mean approximately.

15
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.910 
Okay, so, about is like kind of about
approximately what you're saying.

16
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.190 
Okay, so, I have about 10 cousins means I
have around 10 cousins.

17
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.650 
Perhaps 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

18
00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.170 
Okay, so, about means around, approximately.

19
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.210 
Okay, pretty good.

20
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.670 
Excellent.

21
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.490 
Nice.

22
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.550 
My cousin eats too much at family dinners.

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.350 
I'm sure you have a cousin that eats a
lot of family dinners.

24
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.750 
Estoy segura que tienes un cousin que
come muchísimo en las family dinners, en

25
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.530 
las cenas de la familia, las cenas familiares.

26
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.430 
So, my cousin eats too much at family dinners.

27
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.870 
You?

28
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.540 
Pretty good.

29
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.880 
Nice.

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.680 
Once more.

31
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.820 
My cousin eats too much at family dinners.

32
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.220 
Pretty good.

33
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.640 
Nice.

34
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.840 
So, tell me in the commentaries, do you

35
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.220 
have a cousin that eats too much at
family dinners?

36
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.760 
Or is it you?

37
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.820 
¿O eres tú ese cousin?

38
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.200 
¿Tienes uno o eres tú?

39
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
Diles comentarios.

40
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.640 
Pretty good.

41
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.080 
So, remember, remember that we're talking

42
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.940 
about family.

43
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.680 
Okay, we're talking about family.

44
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.000 
So, the next one is uncle.

45
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.160 
Okay, uncle.

46
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.280 
My uncle is handsome.

47
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.920 
My uncle is handsome.

48
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.600 
Mi tío es guapo.

49
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
My uncle is handsome.

50
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.400 
Okay?

51
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.140 
Normally, handsome, we use it for men.

52
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.380 
You know, we can use it for both, but we
normally use it for men.

53
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.620 
Handsome.

54
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.380 
Normalmente se usa para hombres.

55
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.580 
So, my uncle is handsome.

56
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.480 
Look at this guy.

57
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.420 
Isn't he handsome?

58
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.420 
So, my uncle is handsome.

59
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.780 
You, say it with me.

60
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.800 
My uncle is handsome.

61
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.020 
Pretty good.

62
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.340 
Nice.

63
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.000 
Once more.

64
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.200 
My uncle is handsome.

65
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.020 
Excellent.

66
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.600 
Nice.

67
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.200 
That was really great.

68
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.720 
So, he has a daughter.

69
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.200 
He has...

70
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.800 
Remember?

71
00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.280 
He has a daughter.

72
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.640 
Remember?

73
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.240 
She has a big family.

74
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
See?

75
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.920 
He has a daughter.

76
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.820 
So, he has a daughter.

77
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.720 
Say it with me.

78
00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.440 
He has a daughter.

79
00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.580 
Pretty good.

80
00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.100 
Once again.

81
00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.240 
He has a daughter.

82
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.850 
Wow.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.410 
Excellent.

84
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.870 
Excellent.

85
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.550 
So, whenever you refer to someone else
possessing something, you must say has.

86
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:11.210 
Okay?

87
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.170 
When you're talking about she, he, you

88
00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.090 
say has.

89
00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.470 
For example, he has a daughter.

90
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.830 
He has a daughter.

91
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.830 
Okay?

92
00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.030 
He has a daughter.

93
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.230 
Now, she has a hat.

94
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.930 
Look at that.

95
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.210 
She has a hat.

96
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.590 
She has a hat.

97
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.970 
Okay?

98
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
Ella tiene un sombrero.

99
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.130 
She has a hat.

100
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.410 
Or this one.

101
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
He has a burger.

102
00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.250

Él tiene una hamburguesa.

105
00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.770 
So, remember?

106
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.270 
He has.

107
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.370 
She has.

108
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.570 
That was everything for today.

109
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.170 
You did a great job.

110
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.870 
And my phrase for you is, you're making
progress every day.

111
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.150 
Congratulations.

112
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.590 
And today, our goals and achievements

113
00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.570 
were 32 words.

114
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.610 
32 words.

115
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.530 
Nine phrases and expressions.

116
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.850 
And we developed vocabulary, speaking and listening.

117
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.950 
Y desarrollamos vocabulary, speaking and listening.

118
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.450 
So, remember both things you have to do

119
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.290 
on the platform.

120
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.590

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.550 
Así que tú ya sabes de lo que estoy hablando.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.870 
Okay?

128
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.730

Bye bye.
