Welcome to this new lesson.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.170 
Listen to the clip.

4
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.430 
What's your favorite color?

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.020 
Red.

6
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.780 
Lie.

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.180 
What's your favorite color?

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:17.750 
Red.

9
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.570 
Lie.

10
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.270 
So, the very first phrase, what's your name?

11
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.070 
Sorry.

12
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.930 
What's your favorite color?

13
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.410 
The very first phrase, what's your
favorite color?

14
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.650 
What's your favorite color?

15
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.130 
What's your favorite color?

16
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.990 
You say it with me?

17
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.350 
You?

18
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.350 
Pretty good.

19
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.690 
Excellent.

20
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.330 
What's more?

21
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.430 
What's your favorite color?

22
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.230 
Nice.

23
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.250 
So, what's your favorite color?

24
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.590 
Here are some answers.

25
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.930 
I don't have a specific favorite, but I

26
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.110 
like red.

27
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.790 
It's vibrant.

28
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.010 
So, I don't have a specific favorite, but
I like red.

29
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.630 
It's vibrant.

30
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.850 
No tengo un favorito específico, pero me

31
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.510 
gusta el rojo.

32
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.190 
Es vibrante.

33
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.850 
Okay?

34
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.230 
So, I don't have a specific favorite, but

35
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.090 
I like red.

36
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.170 
It's vibrant.

37
00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.450 
I don't have a specific favorite, but I
like red.

38
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
It's vibrant.

39
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.980 
Pretty good.

40
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.400 
Excellent.

41
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.820 
Excellent.

42
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:20.760 
One more time.

43
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.940 
I don't have a specific favorite

44
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.840 
, but I like red.

45
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.580 
It's vibrant.

46
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.280 
Pretty good.

47
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.900 
Nice.

48
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.280 
Excellent.

49
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.780 
Excellent.

50
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.540 
So, the next one is, I prefer green.

51
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.700 
I prefer green.

52
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.060 
Okay?

53
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.940 
Say it with me.

54
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.870 
I prefer green.

55
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.470 
Pretty good.

56
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.210 
Again, I prefer green.

57
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.610 
Nice.

58
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.990 
Excellent.

59
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.310 
I don't like to discuss personal matters

60
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.770 
at work.

61
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.330 
I don't like to discuss personal matters

62
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.450 
at work.

63
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.870 
No me gusta discutir cosas personales o

64
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.410 
asuntos personales en el trabajo.

65
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.090 
Okay?

66
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.390 
So, I don't like to discuss personal
matters at work.

67
00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.050 
I don't like to discuss personal matters
at work.

68
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.820 
Thank you.

69
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.400 
Pretty good.

70
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.780 
Excellent.

71
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.720 
One more time.

72
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.080 
I don't like to discuss personal matters
at work.

73
00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.480 
Pretty good.

74
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.260 
So, now I have a question for you.

75
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.060 
There's some people that think, or
there's people, perhaps there are a lot,

76
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.660 
or perhaps there are a few, people that
think that your personal ethic has

77
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.340 
nothing to do, your personal moral ethic
has nothing to do with your, uh, with

78
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.840 
your work, with your job, what you do,
you know, what you do for a living.

79
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.780 
So, what do you think about that?

80
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.140 
Is that right?

81
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.700 
Yes?

82
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.700 
No?

83
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.980 
No, why, why not?

84
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.440 
Okay?

85
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.300 
So, check out in the comments below.

86
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
Tell me what you think about that

87
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:55.200 
.

88
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.580 
Okay?

89
00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.180 
So, lo que estaba diciendo es que hay
personas que creen que, o muchas, puede

90
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.600 
ser muchas, puede ser pocas, personas que
creen que su moral, ética personal, no

91
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.780 
tiene nada que ver con la ética laboral
que tienen.

92
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:10.040 
Okay?

93
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.760 
So, quiero saber.

94
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.000 
Tell me in English, in the comments, in English.

95
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.200 
Do you think that's right?

96
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.380 
Piensas que está bien?

97
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.640 
O piensas que está mal?

98
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.100 
¿Por qué sí?

99
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.560 
¿Por qué no?

100
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.660 
I will read the comments down below.

101
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.300 
So, I don't like to discuss personal

102
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.440 
matters at work.

103
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.980 
The next one.

104
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.380 
We're going to check out some videos.

105
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.420 
Vamos a ver algunos videos.

106
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.680 
Y tú vas a decir, de acuerdo con los
videos, puedes decir las siguientes frases.

107
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.260 
La primera.

108
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.320 
I don't like it.

109
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.360 
No me gusta.

110
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.940 
I don't like it.

111
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.950 
I don't like it.

112
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.870 
Pretty good.

113
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.490 
Excellent.

114
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.770 
Excellent.

115
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.450 
The second.

116
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.190 
I like it.

117
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.730 
Pretty good.

118
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.210 
Nice.

119
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.100 
Or, I love it.

120
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.820 
I love it.

121
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.560 
Pretty good.

122
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.920 
Nice.

123
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.040 
Nice.

124
00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.840 
So, dependiendo del video y de lo que tú

125
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.800 
pienses, puedes decir I like it, I love
it, or I don't like it.

126
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:04.920 
So, check out the videos.

127
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.580 
Mira los videos.

128
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.060 
Cheesecake ramen.

129
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.960 
I gotta try out.

130
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.620 
Maybe it'll taste really good.

131
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.660 
Okay, I'm ready.

132
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.760 
Oh, it's a little bit spicy.

133
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.120 
The texture of the noodle is so good.

134
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.000 
Some pork.

135
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.640 
Some cheesecake.

136
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.860 
Chate.

137
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.600 
The cake is really good on its own.

138
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:28.520 
Now, I'm going to eat it together.

139
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.520 
No.

140
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.740 
No.

141
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.780 
This is so strange.

142
00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:31.520 
It's pretty weird.

143
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.200 
I don't think it tastes good together.

144
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.480 
I decided to mix it in and it tasted so
much better.

145
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.600 
So, would you try this?

146
00:04:37.610 --> 00:05:50.800 
Let me know in the comments.

147
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.300 
The mistakes are proofs that you're
trying and that you're learning, okay?

148
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.420 
Recuerda que los errores son la prueba de
que tú estás intentando y de que estás aprendiendo.

149
00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.980 
So, keep on going with that.

150
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:02.940 
Remember to comment the class and rate

151
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.180 
the class.

152
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.920 
And what we achieved today were 36 words,

153
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.040 
8 phrases, and we developed vocabulary,
speaking, and listening.

154
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:17.660 
Congratulations and bye -bye.

155
00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:18.160 
See ya.
