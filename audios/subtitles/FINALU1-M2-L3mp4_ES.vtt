For today, we're going to listen to two
audios, two conversations, and you're

4
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.840 
going to answer two questions.

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.200 
For conversation number one, you're going

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.040 
to say, and cry in the chat box, where
does Felipe live?

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.720 
¿Ok?

8
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.540

comentarios dónde vive Felipe.
