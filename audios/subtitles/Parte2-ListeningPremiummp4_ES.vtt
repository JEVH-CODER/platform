00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.960 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.340 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.480 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.800 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.060 
We'll also learn about contractions.

6
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.480 
Let's get started
.

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.280 
Elision.

8
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.920 
Sometimes sounds are dropped when we

9
00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.260 
speak quickly.

10
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.560 
Examples.

11
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.560 
Aquí inicia tu ejercicio.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.260 
Recuerda que tienes que escuchar la

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.100 
frase, la palabra clave, pausar el video
y repetir.

14
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.580 
¿Listo?

15
00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.560 
Y después sigues para que escuches otras

16
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.720

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.480 
I woulda, I woulda, I woulda.

23
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.400 
You coulda told me earlier.

24
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.820 
You coulda, you coulda, you coulda.

25
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.860

Assimilation.

43
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.860 
When two sounds are next to each other,

44
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
one may change to sound more like the other.

45
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.480 
Examples.

46
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.540
