00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.670 
Right there, right there.

2
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.910 
I love McDonald's.

3
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.810 
I love jobs.

4
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.930 
I like to see good jobs, and I think it's

5
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.550 
inappropriate when somebody puts down all
over the place that she worked at McDonald's.

6
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.570 
It was a big part of her resume that she
worked at McDonald's, how tough a job it was.

7
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.190 
She specifically worked at the French
fry, where they make the French fries,

8
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.230 
and she talked about the heat.

9
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.150 
It was so tough.

10
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.810 
She never worked at McDonald's.

11
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.550 
Keep it tight.

12
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.570 
You got the salt on it.

13
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.280 
It never touches the human hand.
