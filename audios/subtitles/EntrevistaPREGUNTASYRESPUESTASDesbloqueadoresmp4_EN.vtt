00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.000 
Bueno, entonces, ahora vamos a tener una
corta entrevista o una conversación y yo

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.500 
voy a hacer unas preguntas, ok?

3
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.600 
Y voy a dar la respuesta.

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.700 
Este video tienes que verlo para que te
puedas aprender el uso de los desbloqueadores.

5
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.900 
Así que vamos a ello.

6
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
What I mean is that I'm a mix of

7
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.720 
introverted and outgoing, depending on
the situation.

8
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.160 
Do you come from a big family?

9
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
My family is rather small.

10
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.180 
A long time ago, my family used to live
in the countryside, and we're still close

11
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.740 
-knit despite being small.

12
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.060 
We're small family.

13
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:57.440 
Do you think first impressions matter?

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.780 
Well, they do.

15
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.480 
But I think that actions over time matter more.

16
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.440 
What's something you'd recommend to

17
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.700 
someone meeting your family?

18
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.960 
Well, I would like to know how they feel

19
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.200 
about pets, because my family loves animals.

20
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.400 
What would you do to make someone feel

21
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.080 
comfortable meeting new people?

22
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.040 
What I would do is introduce them to everyone.

23
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.940 
Help them break the ice.

24
00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
Do you think family traditions are important?

25
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.100 
I think they can create bonds and
memories, so yes, they are important.

26
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.600 
Do you believe everyone in a family has
to think alike?

27
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.560 
I don't think that everyone needs to
think alike.

28
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.460 
But respecting differences is crucial.

29
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.200 
What's your idea about family?

30
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.600 
Everyone can be family.

31
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.580 
That is to say, family is about support,

32
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.340 
not just blood relations.

33
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.500 
How would you describe your relationship

34
00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.500 
with your siblings?

35
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.380 
I mean, we argue sometimes, but we've

36
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.120 
always got each other's backs.

37
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.060 
Do you keep any childhood items?

38
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.200 
I have a box of toys from when I was little.

39
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.460 
Do you believe in learning from mistakes?

40
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.600 
Absolutely, I've learned from my mistakes
several times.

41
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.260 
And that's how I've grown into the person
that I am today.

42
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.520 
Have you ever planned something and had
it fall through?

43
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.800 
I was going to do a surprise party for my
dad, but he found out beforehand.

44
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.860 
Where were you raised?

45
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
I was raised in the suburbs for most of

46
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.700 
my life.

47
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.340 
Were you always confident growing up?

48
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.600 
I was shy as a child, but I've grown to
be confident over time.

49
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.980 
Have you ever been caught off guard by
someone's expectation?

50
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.660 
I didn't know that my grandparents wanted
me to take over their business.

51
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.860 
How do you deal with bad weather?

52
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.860 
Yesterday, I didn't want to go out

53
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.520 
because it was raining heavily.

54
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.260 
It was raining cats and dogs.

55
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.200 
How do you make difficult tasks more manageable?

56
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.040 
So that it isn't overwhelming, I break it

57
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.120 
into smaller steps.

58
00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.180 
Do you think you're good at explaining things?

59
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.000 
Well, I don't know, but what I wanted to
say is that I try to do my best.

60
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.360 
What's one thing you're curious about
right now?

61
00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.840 
Well, I want to know how you spend your weekends.

62
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.160 
How do you handle misunderstandings?

63
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.480 
Well, just tell me what I can do better
and we'll work it out.

64
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.940 
What advice would you give to someone
who's hesitant about making changes?

65
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.700 
Well, if I were that person, I'd take it
one step at a time and not overthink it.

66
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
What's something you'd like to achieve soon?

67
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.540 
I want to learn how to cook my family's

68
00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.780 
traditional recipes.

69
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.720 
Why do you think people hesitate about

70
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.800 
trying new things?

71
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.680 
Well, mostly because I don't know how to

72
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.360 
do it.

73
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.760 
I might feel unsure.

74
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.540 
And I imagine people feel the same
.

75
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.440 
I imagine others feel the same.

76
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.480 
What do you focus on when you're busy?

77
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.100 
Concentrating.

78
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.500 
Because when I concentrate, I get more

79
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.780 
done in less time.

80
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.640 
Why are you pursuing this hobby?

81
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.340 
Because I like to challenge myself to
improve and grow.

82
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.320 
How do you politely move through a
crowded space?

83
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.780 
Well, I just say, excuse me, please, can
I get through?

84
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.040 
Have you tried solving this type of
issues before?

85
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.940 
Several times.

86
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.400 
And I've learned something new each time.

87
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.340 
Do you visit the same vacation spot often?

88
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.120 
Many times.

89
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.360 
I love how familiar and relaxing it feels.

90
00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.020 
Do you ever skip taking a shower?

91
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.660 
Sometimes.

92
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.900 
But I try not to make it a habit.

93
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
Do you enjoy childhood activities?

94
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.060 
Once in a while, I like to re -watch

95
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.000 
childhood movies.

96
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.760 
Do you think everyone values family the

97
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.640 
same way?

98
00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.800 
Some people prioritize it more and other

99
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.480 
people focus on other things.

100
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.440 
Can you name a food you like?

101
00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:34.020 
Yes.

102
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.800 
For example, I love pasta.

103
00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.120 
It's my comfort food.

104
00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.360 
Do you usually agree with your friends' opinions?

105
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.260 
I agree with their thoughts and most
things, but not always.

106
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.340 
Do you find it hard to express disagreement?

107
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.820 
I don't agree with others just to please them.

108
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.200 
I believe in honesty.

109
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.520 
Do you think it's okay to ask for help?

110
00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.760 
Yes, of course.

111
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.640 
It shows strength, not weakness.

112
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.500 
Do you listen more than you talk?

113
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.440 
I understand the importance of listening,

114
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.400 
so I try to do both.

115
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.280 
Do you find any topics hard to understand?

116
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.060 
I don't understand complicated math problems.

117
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.300 
It's not my strong sweep.

118
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.480 
When you say that you value connection,
what do you mean?

119
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.120 
What do you mean by connection?

120
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.600 
I'd say it's about meaningful relationships.

121
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.300 
What do you do when faced with setbacks?

122
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.340 
It's not comfortable, however, I stay

123
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.780 
focused and find a way to adapt.

124
00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.520 
When did you last visit your hometown?

125
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:37.260 
Years ago, but I'm planning a trip back soon.

126
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.320 
What's the first thing you'd like us to

127
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.280 
know about you?

128
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.460 
First of all, that I value honesty and

129
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.900 
open communication.

130
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.400 
Do you easily believe what others tell you?

131
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:50.320 
I don't believe that everything people
says is true.

132
00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.900 
I prefer to verify it myself.

133
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.480 
Do you think you'll succeed in your next goal?

134
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.840 
I believe that with hard work and
persistence, I absolutely will succeed.

135
00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:04.900 
Okay, last but not least, what do you
want me to do?

136
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.460 
Well, that's a good question.

137
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.420 
I think, help me learn English fast.

138
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.700 
Wow, muy bien.

139
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.600 
Eso es todo por este video.

140
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.900 
Míralo de nuevo hasta que puedas entender
bien lo que estamos diciendo.
