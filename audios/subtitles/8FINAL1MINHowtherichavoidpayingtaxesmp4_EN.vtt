00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.160 
This is Warren Buffett, one of the
richest people in the world, thanks to

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.020 
the company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway.

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.460 
Basically, it's a holding company that

4
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.320 
just owns a bunch of other companies,
Geico, Dairy Queen, a huge railroad, as

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.940 
well as a lot of stock in other
companies, like Apple and Coca -Cola.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.760 
So when those companies do well and their
stock goes up, Berkshire Hathaway stock

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.160 
goes up.

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.160 
When Buffett took over the company in

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.140 
1965, a single share was worth $19.

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.000 
Today, it's worth nearly half a million dollars.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.660 
Buffett owns nearly 240 ,000 of these shares.

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.120 
This is where his wealth is.

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.340 
But as he's been known for pointing out,
Warren Buffett still pays a lower tax

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.440 
rate than his secretary.

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.300 
She pays at twice the rate I pay.

16
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900 
I think that's outrageous.

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.120 
That's because they pay different types

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.720 
of taxes.

19
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.420 
His secretary pays income taxes on her

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.200 
salary, but Buffett mainly pays capital
gains taxes on his sold stock.

21
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.680 
And that's taxed at nearly half the rate.

22
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020 
The wealthy are definitely under -taxed.
