00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.460 
Once upon a time, on a boat gently moving
under the sun, lived a man named Ben, his

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:07.320 
wife, Sarah, and their daughter, Lily.

3
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.100 
They had made this boat their home, but

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.760 
it was more than just a place to live.

5
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.480 
It was their jam, inside, behind worn

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.180 
wooden walls.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.440 
They had a small clothes factory.

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.440 
Ben had always wanted to work for
himself, and, well, the boat idea just clicked.

9
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.040 
It was a risky move, but they took the
chance, and now they were producing the

10
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.080 
most unique, handcrafted clothes.

11
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.060 
This is where their story begins, where

12
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.880 
work, family, and secrets weave together
like threads in a fabric.

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.780 
Every day, they moved the boat near small
coastal towns, offering their clothes to

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.600 
curious visitors.

15
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.780 
Who knew you could make a whole factory

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
fit on a boat?

17
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.020 
People would often say, staring in

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940 
disbelief, Ben always smiled and replied,
Well, when pigs fly, you'll see a factory

19
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.360 
that works harder than this one.

20
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.600 
Lily, now 17 years old, had lived on the

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.640 
boat her whole life.

22
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.180 
She knew its creaks, its sounds, and the

23
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.240 
salty air that filled every corner.

24
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.240 
She loved to play on the deck, sometimes

25
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.480 
imagining they were on an adventure in
far -off lands.

26
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.640 
One day, as they finished their last
piece of clothing for the week, Sarah

27
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.820 
called Lily inside.

28
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.800 
Come help me fold these shirts.

29
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.240 
We've got a big order tomorrow.

30
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.020 
How big?

31
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.280 
Lily asked, curious.

32
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.420 
About 500 shirts.

33
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.720 
Her mother replied, her hands moving swiftly.

34
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.080 
I hope we get it done in time.

35
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920 
Ben, listening from behind them, sighed,
If we keep cutting corners, we're going

36
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.320 
to have to go back to square one.

37
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
We've already burned the midnight oil

38
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.140 
three times this week.

39
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.140 
Sarah stopped folding and looked at him.

40
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.100 
Don't worry.

41
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.660 
We'll make it work.

42
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.200 
We always do.

43
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
The nights on the boat were quiet, with

44
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.440 
the occasional sound of the waves beneath them.

45
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.220 
But one night, something changed.

46
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.800 
It was a calm evening.

47
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.640 
Lily had just turned off the lights and

48
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.540 
was about to fall asleep when she heard it.

49
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
A soft bump against the side of the boat.

50
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.660 
She sat up, her heart racing.

51
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.600 
Dad?

52
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.920 
She called out softly.

53
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.380 
No answer.

54
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.340 
Cautiously, she tiptoed outside.

55
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.820 
There, near the back of the boat, she saw

56
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.600 
something or someone moving in the shadows.

57
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.000 
Ben exclaimed the next morning, as Lily

58
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.620 
told her parents what she saw.

59
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.180 
I swear, there was someone there.

60
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.920 
I couldn't see them clearly, but I'm not
making this up.

61
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.620 
Lily said.

62
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.660 
Her voice high -key shook.

63
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.380 
Ben and Sarah exchanged worried glances.

64
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.400 
Okay.

65
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.380 
Sarah said calmly, Maybe it's nothing,
but we'll keep an eye out.

66
00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.880 
Let's not get salty over it.

67
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.360 
Over the next few days, strange things

68
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.040 
started to happen.

69
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.940 
A batch of shirts, which had been neatly

70
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.220 
folded, appeared out of place.

71
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.360 
Once, they even found a shirt completely

72
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.720 
soaked, despite having left it dry under
the roof.

73
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.700 
Lily would wake up in the middle of the
night, hearing footsteps outside her room.

74
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.420 
This is getting sus.

75
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.520 
She whispered one morning to her dad.

76
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.200 
What do you mean?

77
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.700 
Ben asked, glancing over at Sarah.

78
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.600 
How could there be anyone on board
without us noticing?

79
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.120 
I don't know, but it's vibing way off.

80
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.600 
That afternoon, they decided to search

81
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.860 
every inch of the boat.

82
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.660 
They looked under every shelf, behind

83
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.300 
every curtain, but found nothing, until
Ben opened the storage room door.

84
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.480 
There, inside, hidden behind the boxes of
fabric, they found an old man.

85
00:03:54.490 --> 00:04:00.580 
His clothes were ragged, his face worn by
the sea, and his eyes wide with fear.

86
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:01.480 
What the?

87
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.420 
Ben muttered, backing up.

88
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.220 
Sarah gasped, and Lily stood frozen.

89
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.420 
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.340 
The old man said, holding up his hands.

91
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.620 
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

92
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.260 
I've just been hiding here for a few days.

93
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.360 
Please, please, don't kick me out.

94
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:23.080 
Who are you?

95
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.380 
And what are you doing here?

96
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.980 
Sarah asked her voice firm.

97
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.540 
My name is Tom.

98
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.040 
I used to live in these waters, but I
lost everything.

99
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.140 
I saw your boat, and I thought I could,
you know, hide.

100
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.720 
I didn't want to bother you, I swear.

101
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.560 
Ben was speechless, but Lily felt a

102
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.200 
strange sympathy for the man.

103
00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.100 
Dad.

104
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.920 
She whispered, Maybe we could help him.

105
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.420 
No way.

106
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.520 
Ben replied, shaking his head.

107
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.320 
We're not running a charity here.

108
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.780 
But Sarah thought for a moment.

109
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.020 
Why don't you work with us for a while?

110
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.060 
You can help with the clothes, and once
you've earned enough, we'll let you go.

111
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.460 
Tom's eyes lit up.

112
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.240 
I'd be so grateful.

113
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
He said, his voice low -key desperate.

114
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.960 
Weeks passed, and Tom became part of

115
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.460 
their routine.

116
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.660 
He worked hard, sewing and cutting,

117
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.940 
making the most out of what little he had.

118
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.740 
But Lily would ask him questions all the time.

119
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.180 
How old are you?

120
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.340 
She asked once.

121
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.580 
Sixty -two.

122
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.340 
He replied, I've been on these waters for

123
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.600 
as long as I can remember.

124
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:43.500 
But as time went on, more secrets began

125
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.060 
to spill.

126
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.260 
Lily overheard Tom talking to someone on

127
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.480 
the radio late one night.

128
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.900 
Could you say that again?

129
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.420 
He whispered from the shadows.

130
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.820 
He repeated something about a shipment,

131
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.040 
about someone coming to take the boat.

132
00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.480 
Lily felt her heart skip a beat.

133
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.380 
She went straight to her parents.

134
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.640 
Tom isn't who he says he is.

135
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.820 
He's planning something, something big.

136
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.600 
I heard him say they're coming for the boat.

137
00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.800 
Ben, now suspicious, decided to confront Tom.

138
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.500 
What's really going on here?

139
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.940 
He demanded the next morning.

140
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.160 
Tom, caught off guard, stuttered.

141
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.360 
I didn't want to involve you.

142
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.440 
I owe a lot of people a lot of money.

143
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.840 
They've been chasing me, and I thought,
maybe this boat could save me.

144
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.240 
And now they're coming for us?

145
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.100 
Sarah asked, her voice sharp.

146
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.700 
Tom hung his head.

147
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:39.540 
Yes.

148
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.380 
I'm sorry.

149
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:44.180 
I didn't mean for this to happen.

150
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.900 
The family had no choice.

151
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.360 
They packed up their things and moved the

152
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:53.480 
boat further out to sea, hoping to avoid
the danger coming their way.

153
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.160 
But deep down, they knew they were on
thin ice.

154
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.740 
Tom had brought trouble into their lives,
and the question now was, how long could

155
00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.120 
they escape it?

156
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.140 
How long did they escape it?

157
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.460 
How long did he escape it?

158
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.560 
How long did he escape it?

159
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.640 
Thank you.
