00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:01.014 
Hi.

2
00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:02.904 
My name is Sarah, and
welcome to you a day

3
00:00:02.904 --> 00:00:04.554 
in the life of a
software engineer.

4
00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:06.894 
Come on in.

5
00:00:06.894 --> 00:00:08.424 
So I woke up at 5:00 today.

6
00:00:08.424 --> 00:00:09.894 
I already got my workout in.

7
00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:13.314 
I took care of my fur kids
and gave them a little love.

8
00:00:13.314 --> 00:00:15.173 
But I officially
can't start my workday

9
00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:19.874 
without a cup of coffee,
so I make a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:19.874 --> 00:00:22.464 
A software engineer
develops software

11
00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:24.624 
for multiple companies.

12
00:00:24.624 --> 00:00:28.494 
I have been working at my
company for about five years,

13
00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.564 
but I've been coding for
a little over a decade.

14
00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:34.734 
My usual schedule
is 8:00 to 4:00,

15
00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.984 
it's kind of nice to be
able to take a break here

16
00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:40.704 
and there to do anything that
I need to around the house

17
00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:43.114 
or go to a store if I need to.

18
00:00:43.114 --> 00:00:45.564 
So the task that I
perform on a daily basis

19
00:00:45.564 --> 00:00:48.504 
include updating
my code if somebody

20
00:00:48.504 --> 00:00:50.394 
requested a change that I make.

21
00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:55.254 
Sometimes I spend a
lot of time replying

22
00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.444 
to emails if that's necessary.

23
00:00:57.444 --> 00:00:59.724 
I check in on my
interns to see if they

24
00:00:59.724 --> 00:01:01.374 
need any help with anything.

25
00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:05.304 
My desk setup consists
of two external monitors,

26
00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:08.694 
and one's for code, one is for
seeing my changes, and then

27
00:01:08.694 --> 00:01:12.444 
my computer for emails and
different terminal things.

28
00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:16.044 
I also just have a little
fun space where my birthday

29
00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:19.104 
cards sit, and then a whole
slew of different mice

30
00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:20.124 
and keyboards.

31
00:01:20.124 --> 00:01:23.184 
So the first thing that I'm
going to do today coding-wise

32
00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:26.604 
is making sure that
what I built works.

33
00:01:26.604 --> 00:01:29.394 
This can usually take
between 30 minutes to an hour

34
00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:30.874 
depending on what
I'm working on.

35
00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:33.264 
So right now my primary
language is include

36
00:01:33.264 --> 00:01:36.574 
Java and a lot of HTML and CSS.

37
00:01:36.574 --> 00:01:41.364 
But I find the most fun in
writing anything based out

38
00:01:41.364 --> 00:01:42.264 
of JavaScript.

39
00:01:42.264 --> 00:01:43.734 
So like Node.js.

40
00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.164 
So I personally use Sublime.

41
00:01:46.164 --> 00:01:50.824 
I think it's very low-effort
and is really easy to use.

42
00:01:50.824 --> 00:01:53.663 
It's really difficult to
write code the first time

43
00:01:53.663 --> 00:01:54.414 
and it be right.

44
00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:57.414 
So either you're going to find
a mistake or somebody is going

45
00:01:57.414 --> 00:01:59.364 
to say, hey, this isn't
really working the way

46
00:01:59.364 --> 00:02:01.374 
that you said it would,
and you're just going

47
00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:02.634 
to have to be OK with that.

48
00:02:02.634 --> 00:02:05.034 
The first thing I quoted
today was the Delete button.

49
00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:06.684 
And so you can
see the code here.

50
00:02:06.684 --> 00:02:10.824 
And this page is
represented on this page

51
00:02:10.824 --> 00:02:12.774 
as the UI or the frontend.

52
00:02:12.774 --> 00:02:16.794 
And you can see that each what
I call card has a Delete button.

53
00:02:16.794 --> 00:02:19.674 
And so now, if you
click on Delete,

54
00:02:19.674 --> 00:02:22.524 
it'll delete that specific
card, and now there

55
00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:23.484 
are no collections.

56
00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:31.584 
One of the benefits of working
from home as a software

57
00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:34.354 
engineer is being
able to cook at home.

58
00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.314 
It's my form of
meditation to kind of-- it

59
00:02:37.314 --> 00:02:38.777 
repositions my brain.

60
00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:40.944 
I get to think about what
I'm going to work on next.

61
00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:45.384 
I get to process maybe a
meeting that I was just in.

62
00:02:45.384 --> 00:02:47.364 
But cooking is
really a way for me

63
00:02:47.364 --> 00:02:50.342 
to recenter myself for the day.

64
00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.634 
I like to spend time on
Reddit, and I think a lot of us

65
00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:54.824 
do when we're on the
computer, pretty much all day.

66
00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:57.374 
But just so catch
up on YouTube videos

67
00:02:57.374 --> 00:02:59.924 
or maybe just talk to
my friends on Discord,

68
00:02:59.924 --> 00:03:02.564 
maybe plan what I'm going
to do for the evening.

69
00:03:02.564 --> 00:03:05.114 
But that usually is
about 30 to 45 minutes.

70
00:03:05.114 --> 00:03:07.964 
Right after lunch,
I to get into work.

71
00:03:07.964 --> 00:03:12.014 
And since most of my meetings
occur in the morning,

72
00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:13.844 
I really get a
longer time period

73
00:03:13.844 --> 00:03:16.874 
in the afternoon to have
my next coding session.

74
00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:20.084 
So it can range between
one to two hours instead

75
00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:21.644 
of having to take breaks.

76
00:03:21.644 --> 00:03:24.204 
I feel the most creative
in the afternoon.

77
00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:27.104 
I think that's because
I've had all of my coffee

78
00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:30.614 
and I've had my
food or my snacks,

79
00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:34.854 
and I really just am
into the meat of the day.

80
00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:37.574 
So in the afternoons,
I have more energy

81
00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:41.384 
in my brain to accomplish the
tasks that I set for myself.

82
00:03:41.384 --> 00:03:45.044 
I like to keep up with new
software and new frameworks

83
00:03:45.044 --> 00:03:47.774 
that happen and
come up by actually

84
00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:50.534 
looking through job openings.

85
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:54.384 
And if there is a new framework
that's really important,

86
00:03:54.384 --> 00:03:56.474 
a lot of companies will
post that in their job

87
00:03:56.474 --> 00:03:57.834 
description or a requirement.

88
00:03:57.834 --> 00:04:01.124 
So I'll kind of go through
what jobs are available

89
00:04:01.124 --> 00:04:03.224 
and see what companies
are using most of,

90
00:04:03.224 --> 00:04:06.414 
and sometimes I even learn
about new frameworks that way.

91
00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:08.384 
Another great thing
about working from home

92
00:04:08.384 --> 00:04:10.304 
is being able to
leave if I have to.

93
00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:12.434 
And I'm feeling something
really spicy tonight,

94
00:04:12.434 --> 00:04:14.294 
so there's this store that
I'm going to go to and do

95
00:04:14.294 --> 00:04:15.377 
a little grocery shopping.

96
00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:24.364 
If you're looking to become
a better software engineer,

97
00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:28.174 
I would recommend maybe
going to a class website

98
00:04:28.174 --> 00:04:30.874 
like Udemy or a
coding boot camp,

99
00:04:30.874 --> 00:04:33.214 
or even just kind of
thinking about a project

100
00:04:33.214 --> 00:04:35.584 
that you'd like to build and
starting it from scratch.

101
00:04:35.584 --> 00:04:37.924 
Gaining experience by
doing is the best way

102
00:04:37.924 --> 00:04:40.534 
to keep yourself up to date
and become a better software

103
00:04:40.534 --> 00:04:41.164 
engineer.

104
00:04:41.164 --> 00:04:44.291 
I got into my profession
kind of by accident.

105
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:46.624 
I knew that I wanted to write,
so I actually started off

106
00:04:46.624 --> 00:04:48.004 
as a journalism major.

107
00:04:48.004 --> 00:04:50.834 
But I wanted to kind of
work with my creative side,

108
00:04:50.834 --> 00:04:53.884 
so I decided to write
code, which I am writing,

109
00:04:53.884 --> 00:04:55.724 
but I'm also using
my creative side.

110
00:04:55.724 --> 00:04:58.264 
So I went from being a
journalism major to a software

111
00:04:58.264 --> 00:04:59.374 
engineer.

112
00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:02.434 
My goals for my future
are to kind of transition

113
00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:04.604 
into more of a management role.

114
00:05:04.604 --> 00:05:08.884 
So I enrolled myself into a
project management course.

115
00:05:08.884 --> 00:05:11.134 
What's nice about
being in this field

116
00:05:11.134 --> 00:05:13.924 
is that continuing
education is very

117
00:05:13.924 --> 00:05:16.444 
important to a lot of
people, so you get time

118
00:05:16.444 --> 00:05:17.614 
to be able to do that.

119
00:05:17.614 --> 00:05:20.494 
I usually wrap up my day
by going through my emails

120
00:05:20.494 --> 00:05:22.744 
and making sure that I didn't
miss anything that I was

121
00:05:22.744 --> 00:05:24.994 
supposed to get to by today.

122
00:05:24.994 --> 00:05:27.424 
I check my work
schedule for tomorrow

123
00:05:27.424 --> 00:05:28.879 
to see if there
are any meanings.

124
00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:31.264 
The last thing I like to
do at the end of the day

125
00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:34.384 
or I have to do at the end
of the day is log my time.

126
00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:38.854 
So I worked on the frontend
for about four hours today,

127
00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:42.844 
and I worked on other things
for about another four hours.

128
00:05:42.844 --> 00:05:44.944 
So that's eight hours.

129
00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:47.414 
And I try to end
my day around 4:00

130
00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:49.414 
so that I have enough
time at the end of the day

131
00:05:49.414 --> 00:05:51.544 
to kind of wind down from it.

132
00:05:51.544 --> 00:05:53.704 
Software engineering
can be pretty stressful,

133
00:05:53.704 --> 00:05:57.154 
so the best way for me to wind
down from a stressful workday

134
00:05:57.154 --> 00:05:58.714 
is to play video games.

135
00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:00.994 
It's just a really
easy and relaxing game

136
00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:03.004 
to wind down my day.

137
00:06:03.004 --> 00:06:06.394 
So I think coding
asks a lot from you

138
00:06:06.394 --> 00:06:09.794 
and it takes a lot
of energy to do it.

139
00:06:09.794 --> 00:06:13.094 
So I would recommend just
being OK with a high-stress,

140
00:06:13.094 --> 00:06:15.164 
high-energy environment.

141
00:06:15.164 --> 00:06:19.294 
I wish I knew how tough it
would be entering the field,

142
00:06:19.294 --> 00:06:21.724 
but all you have to do
is be confident and make

143
00:06:21.724 --> 00:06:25.414 
sure to speak your mind
and just be yourself

144
00:06:25.414 --> 00:06:27.934 
and it's going to be OK.

145
00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:29.264 
Thanks for watching.

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:32.144 
Be sure to give us like and
subscribe to Indeed's channel.

147
00:06:32.144 --> 00:06:34.984 
See you next time.

148
00:06:34.984 --> 00:06:36.634 
Hi, welcome to
the grocery store.

149
00:06:36.634 --> 00:06:37.474 
Let's go shopping.

150
00:06:37.474 --> 00:06:39.514 
Come on over.

151
00:06:39.514 --> 00:06:40.324 
Oh, am I going?

152
00:06:40.324 --> 00:06:42.774 
OK, away we go.
