00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.240 
With both hands, Maria stepped into the
bath, ready to begin her daily ritual.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.160 
The path she walked each morning led her
to reflect on the earth and its wonders.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.800 
This month marked a year since the birth
of her daughter, a joyous occasion that

4
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.340 
had forever changed her perspective on
life and death.

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.220 
Faith had always been important to Maria,
but now it took on new meaning as she

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.680 
witnessed the growth of her child.

7
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.560 
The worth of every moment became clearer,

8
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.280 
and she treasured her family's health
above all else.

9
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.280 
As she dried off, Maria pondered the
truth of her existence.

10
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.980 
She realized that wealth wasn't just
about money, but about the richness of

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.660 
experiences and relationships.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.580 
With this understanding came a newfound

13
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.880 
strength, one that would guide her
through whatever challenges lay ahead.
