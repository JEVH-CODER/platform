00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.080 
Jack likes to wind his old watch every morning.

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.600 
He wounded yesterday and has wound it

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.460 
daily for years.

4
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.140 
He writes news stories for a living.

5
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.640 
He wrote an interesting article last week
and has written many popular pieces.

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.520 
Problems often arise in his work.

7
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.860 
A big story arose unexpectedly yesterday,

8
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.000 
and such situations have arisen
frequently in his career.

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.260 
Jack has become more adaptable over time.

10
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.240 
He became a senior reporter last year and

11
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.700 
has become well -known in the industry.

12
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.920 
Sometimes, Jack bets on which stories

13
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:33.620 
will be popular.

14
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.580 
He bet on a political piece recently and

15
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.360 
has bet correctly many times before.

16
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Once, while rushing to meet a deadline,

17
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.420 
he cut his finger and it began to bleed.

18
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.380 
It bled for a while, and he has bled from

19
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.160 
paper cuts more times than he can count.

20
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.980 
The local farm he's reporting on breeds

21
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.680 
rare chickens.

22
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.640 
They bred a new variety last season and

23
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.620 
have bred many unique birds over the years.

24
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.000 
Jack's stories broadcast on local radio.

25
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.920 
This morning's story broadcast live, and
his reports have broadcast to the

26
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:05.920 
community for a decade.

27
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.320 
He's careful not to burn bridges with his sources.

28
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.340 
He burned one connection early in his
career but hasn't burned any

29
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.580 
relationships since then.

30
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.660 
Jack deals with various challenges daily.

31
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.740 
He dealt with a tough interview yesterday
and has dealt with all kinds of

32
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
situations in his job.

33
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.120 
Despite the pressures, Jack finds his

34
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
work as a journalist exciting and fulfilling.

35
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.140 
His friends were prepared for his time to

36
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.240 
get his job and willing.

37
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.060 
Â¡Gracias!
