00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:08.640 
I can't just wait around.

2
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.340 
I need to find David myself.

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.600 
But who should I ask?

4
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.520 
What can I do?

5
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.220 
I know!

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.160 
I'm going to start by calling his girlfriend.

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.120 
Maybe she knows where he could be.

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.840 
Hello, who do you want to talk to?

9
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.500 
Hi, this is Valeria, David's sister.

10
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.760 
He's missing and I'm really worried about him.

11
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.660 
I just finished reporting his disappearance.

12
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.200 
Do you know where he is?

13
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.500 
Have you seen him recently?

14
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.740 
Hi, Valeria, David told me he was going

15
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.580 
to visit a friend yesterday, but he
hasn't called me since then.

16
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.460 
I'm really worried too.

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.520 
Who was this friend?

18
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.800 
I didn't know he was going to meet anyone yesterday.

19
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.900 
I don't know, but he seemed worried.

20
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.600 
I have never seen him so worried before.

21
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.560 
What?

22
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.320 
But he was very calm yesterday before dinner.

23
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.480 
Do you remember Daniel?

24
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.140 
He's the person who can help us.

25
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.080 
What?

26
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.040 
The school's dean?

27
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.000 
Are you kidding me?

28
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.580 
What can he know about my brother?

29
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.200 
Well, he was very close to Daniel.

30
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.080 
I'll go to the park today, that's the
place where they usually meet.

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.720 
I'll ask him if he knows something about Daniel.

32
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.240 
Alright, be careful, that Daniel is a

33
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.600 
womanizer, he flirts with everyone.

34
00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:04.610 
Miss, please come, we want you to

35
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.350 
identify a suspicious body.
