1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.479 
Thank you everyone for

2
00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:02.926 
this.

3
00:00:07.164 --> 00:00:07.938 
Thank you.

4
00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:08.678 
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.678 --> 00:00:09.855 
Let me first give you a

6
00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:10.595 
report on our

7
00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:11.638 
memberships.

8
00:00:11.638 --> 00:00:13.084 
As of the second quarter

9
00:00:13.084 --> 00:00:14.699 
of this year, we had

10
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.307 
1,268,572

11
00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:21.258 
members.

12
00:00:21.762 --> 00:00:23.444 
That is a net gain of

13
00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:25.967 
more than 10,000 members

14
00:00:25.967 --> 00:00:27.178 
from 2023.

15
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.349 
By the end of 2024,

16
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.963 
we project that we will

17
00:00:32.963 --> 00:00:35.015 
have more than 20,000

18
00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:37.706 
net gains in membership.

19
00:00:37.706 --> 00:00:39.859 
By then we will fully

20
00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.709 
rebound membership wise

21
00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:42.987 
from the impacts of the

22
00:00:42.987 --> 00:00:45.005 
pandemic and the outcome

23
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:46.014 
of membership

24
00:00:46.014 --> 00:00:47.931 
addings done in 2022.

25
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:52.674 
The green line on this

26
00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:53.582 
line indicates

27
00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:54.759 
membership at the

28
00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:56.105 
beginning of the year,

29
00:00:56.105 --> 00:00:57.585 
while the orange line

30
00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:59.401 
indicates membership at

31
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.646 
the end of the line.

32
00:01:00.646 --> 00:01:02.462 
The more significant the

33
00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:03.303 
gap between the

34
00:01:03.303 --> 00:01:04.447 
beginning and ending

35
00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:05.960 
point, the higher the

36
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.743 
increase each year in

37
00:01:07.743 --> 00:01:09.391 
our memberships.

38
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.376 
On average, we have

39
00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:13.461 
had about 20,000 net

40
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:14.908 
gains over the past 10

41
00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.421 
years, except for the

42
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:19.045 
period of the pandemic.

43
00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:23.821 
Last year we had 30,620

44
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:26.041 
baptisms and about

45
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:27.958 
14,000 baptism for

46
00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:29.169 
the first half of this

47
00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:31.188 
year and we praise God

48
00:01:31.188 --> 00:01:34.248 
for every soul baptized.

49
00:01:34.988 --> 00:01:36.536 
And we are projecting

50
00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:38.655 
that by the end of 2024,

51
00:01:38.655 --> 00:01:40.168 
we'll probably have more

52
00:01:40.168 --> 00:01:42.758 
than 30,000 baptism

53
00:01:42.758 --> 00:01:44.306 
at the minimum.

54
00:01:44.306 --> 00:01:45.617 
And it is my prayer,

55
00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:47.131 
it is my sincere prayer

56
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:48.678 
that we may have more

57
00:01:48.678 --> 00:01:51.167 
than 40,000 baptism

58
00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:52.917 
at the end of 2025.

59
00:01:54.632 --> 00:01:55.607 
Am I aiming too low?

60
00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:57.626 
I don't think so. 15,000

61
00:01:57.626 --> 00:01:59.408 
yes, yes.

62
00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:00.451 
I think that God is

63
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:01.393 
going to do a lot of

64
00:02:01.393 --> 00:02:02.537 
miracles among us

65
00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:03.108 
through the

66
00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:04.689 
Pentecost 2025.

67
00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:08.625 
By the end of 2023,

68
00:02:08.625 --> 00:02:11.047 
we had more professions of

69
00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:12.964 
faiths than any previous

70
00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:16.025 
year going back to 2014,

71
00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:18.648 
probably is the residual

72
00:02:18.648 --> 00:02:21.137 
effect of the pandemic.

73
00:02:21.205 --> 00:02:22.685 
Let me briefly talk

74
00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:24.804 
about the transfers in

75
00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:26.250 
and out.

76
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.495 
This group of peoples

77
00:02:27.495 --> 00:02:28.706 
moved their membership

78
00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:31.127 
into our division or to

79
00:02:31.127 --> 00:02:32.843 
another divisions in

80
00:02:32.843 --> 00:02:34.525 
2023.

81
00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:36.812 
More than 32,000 people

82
00:02:36.812 --> 00:02:38.662 
transferred in, while

83
00:02:38.662 --> 00:02:41.016 
about 30,000 members

84
00:02:41.016 --> 00:02:43.136 
transferred out.

85
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.288 
Quite a number of people

86
00:02:45.288 --> 00:02:46.466 
are coming in and then

87
00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.450 
transferring out, which

88
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.141 
is a net gain of 2,000.

89
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:51.915 
Our church is a

90
00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:53.395 
worldwide church and our

91
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:55.245 
membership system

92
00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:56.691 
works quite well with

93
00:02:56.691 --> 00:02:57.465 
the other sister

94
00:02:57.465 --> 00:02:58.406 
divisions.

95
00:02:58.406 --> 00:02:59.516 
They have their own

96
00:02:59.516 --> 00:03:00.694 
membership database

97
00:03:00.694 --> 00:03:02.106 
system and we have our

98
00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:04.091 
own and it works

99
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:05.201 
perfectly fine between

100
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.782 
ours, between us and

101
00:03:06.782 --> 00:03:08.867 
our sister divisions.

102
00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:01.912 
The history of mission

103
00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:03.123 
offerings in the 7th Day

104
00:04:03.123 --> 00:04:04.569 
Adventist Church is

105
00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:05.544 
rooted in the

106
00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:06.352 
denomination's

107
00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:08.034 
commitment to spreading

108
00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:10.085 
the gospel worldwide.

109
00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:11.364 
Historically, the North

110
00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:12.877 
American division has

111
00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:13.785 
been the largest

112
00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:14.963 
contributor to the

113
00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:15.938 
Adventist Church's

114
00:04:15.938 --> 00:04:17.485 
global mission work.

115
00:04:17.485 --> 00:04:19.302 
However, as other world

116
00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:20.714 
divisions have grown in

117
00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:22.060 
membership and financial

118
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.044 
capacity, funding global

119
00:04:24.044 --> 00:04:25.323 
missions has become more

120
00:04:25.323 --> 00:04:27.307 
evenly distributed.

121
00:04:27.307 --> 00:04:28.854 
Nonetheless, the NAD

122
00:04:28.854 --> 00:04:30.671 
remains a key financial

123
00:04:30.671 --> 00:04:31.882 
supporter

124
00:04:31.882 --> 00:04:32.622 
of the churches

125
00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:35.649 
worldwide mission work.

126
00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:36.725 
The 7th Day Adventist

127
00:04:36.725 --> 00:04:38.239 
Church systematically

128
00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:39.114 
collects tithes and

129
00:04:39.114 --> 00:04:40.257 
offerings, with a

130
00:04:40.257 --> 00:04:41.670 
portion of these funds

131
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.049 
allocated for mission

132
00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:44.193 
work.

133
00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:46.043 
In 2001, the NAD's

134
00:04:46.043 --> 00:04:47.590 
tithe contribution was

135
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.837 
$685,051,305, which

136
00:04:52.837 --> 00:04:55.393 
represented 61% of the

137
00:04:55.393 --> 00:04:56.403 
world total.

138
00:04:56.403 --> 00:04:58.757 
In the NAD's tithe

139
00:04:58.757 --> 00:05:00.103 
contribution was

140
00:05:00.103 --> 00:05:07.637 
$1,322,728,890.00,

141
00:05:07.637 --> 00:05:10.631 
which represented 42% of

142
00:05:10.631 --> 00:05:12.380 
the world total.

143
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.230 
In 2023, tithe per

144
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.282 
capita in the NAD was in

145
00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:16.753 
U.S.

146
00:05:16.753 --> 00:05:19.376 
dollars 1,052, whereas

147
00:05:19.376 --> 00:05:20.823 
the tithe per capita for

148
00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:21.798 
the other divisions

149
00:05:21.798 --> 00:05:23.783 
combined was in U.S.

150
00:05:23.783 --> 00:05:25.969 
dollars $145

151
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.583 
Please note amounts from

152
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:28.391 
world divisions

153
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:29.803 
fluctuate with the

154
00:05:29.803 --> 00:05:31.384 
relative strength of the

155
00:05:31.384 --> 00:05:32.192 
various giving

156
00:05:32.192 --> 00:05:34.143 
currencies versus the US

157
00:05:34.143 --> 00:05:35.589 
dollar.

158
00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:36.665 
The General Conference

159
00:05:36.665 --> 00:05:38.582 
uses tithe in many ways

160
00:05:38.582 --> 00:05:39.726 
to advance the mission

161
00:05:39.726 --> 00:05:40.802 
of the Church.

162
00:05:40.802 --> 00:05:42.552 
A partial list includes

163
00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:43.796 
mission awareness and

164
00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:44.839 
promotion,

165
00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.184 
communication,

166
00:05:46.184 --> 00:05:48.202 
education, various

167
00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:49.716 
niche ministries,

168
00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:50.860 
coordination,

169
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.407 
consultation, and

170
00:05:52.407 --> 00:05:53.921 
leadership activities

171
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.872 
for the world Church

172
00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:57.520 
through systematic ties

173
00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.202 
and offerings, special

174
00:05:59.202 --> 00:06:00.345 
initiatives, and

175
00:06:00.345 --> 00:06:01.354 
partnerships with the

176
00:06:01.354 --> 00:06:03.036 
General Conference.

177
00:06:03.036 --> 00:06:03.675 
The North American

178
00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:04.752 
division continues to

179
00:06:04.752 --> 00:06:06.803 
play a critical role.

180
00:06:06.803 --> 00:06:07.880 
And ensuring that

181
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.595 
resources are available

182
00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:11.109 
to spread the Adventist

183
00:06:11.109 --> 00:06:13.598 
message worldwide.

184
00:06:13.598 --> 00:06:17.062 
This is our story.

185
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.493 
For the 2024 study,

186
00:06:20.493 --> 00:06:21.637 
we were only asking

187
00:06:21.637 --> 00:06:22.982 
about ethnicity, so

188
00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.126 
we opted to use

189
00:06:24.126 --> 00:06:25.572 
SurveyMonkey rather than

190
00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:27.389 
phone interviews, and

191
00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:28.633 
we were able to invite

192
00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:29.272 
every single

193
00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:30.382 
congregation in North

194
00:06:30.382 --> 00:06:31.930 
America.

195
00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.376 
Little over 2,100

196
00:06:33.376 --> 00:06:35.192 
responded.

197
00:06:35.192 --> 00:06:36.403 
And they provided data

198
00:06:36.403 --> 00:06:37.749 
for all but a few non

199
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:39.632 
attending members.

200
00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:40.440 
This shows the

201
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.146 
percentage of

202
00:06:41.146 --> 00:06:42.458 
congregations in each

203
00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:43.904 
union that participated

204
00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:45.149 
in the survey.

205
00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:46.225 
And you can see there's

206
00:06:46.225 --> 00:06:47.369 
a very even spread.

207
00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:48.983 
This shows the

208
00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:51.102 
percentage of ethnicity

209
00:06:51.102 --> 00:06:52.145 
of congregation that

210
00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.793 
participated in the

211
00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:54.231 
survey.

212
00:06:54.231 --> 00:06:56.518 
And again, very even

213
00:06:56.518 --> 00:06:57.863 
spread.

214
00:06:57.863 --> 00:06:59.007 
The green shows the

215
00:06:59.007 --> 00:07:00.521 
number of members in the

216
00:07:00.521 --> 00:07:01.462 
congregations that

217
00:07:01.462 --> 00:07:02.471 
participated in.

218
00:07:02.471 --> 00:07:03.481 
The yellow shows the

219
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:04.456 
number of members that

220
00:07:04.456 --> 00:07:05.297 
they reported

221
00:07:05.297 --> 00:07:07.416 
In the survey and again

222
00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:08.728 
we see a very even

223
00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.208 
spread there.

224
00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:11.486 
I think it's safe to say

225
00:07:11.486 --> 00:07:12.764 
that it's true is the

226
00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:14.345 
Pew Research's statement

227
00:07:14.345 --> 00:07:16.229 
was in 2015, it's even

228
00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:18.079 
truer today
