Later, she found out that Carson had
another family that he hid from her.

5
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.960 
Despite their best efforts, their
marriage fell apart and ended in divorce.

6
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.140 
Pregunta, question.

7
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.320 
Why did Sonia Carson, the woman in the

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.020 
story, divorced her husband?

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.860 
Numbers 2, second one.

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.500 
After the meeting, Benny felt really sad.

11
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.160 
He thought that he was not smart.

12
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.540 
His mother, however, believed in him.

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.000 
She told him that he was not stupid.

14
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.380 
But very smart.

15
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.720 
And that he just needed to work harder.

Third, now Sonia works multiple jobs like

18
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.550 
cleaning and babysitting to support her family.

19
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.370 
Sonia can't read or cry and this scares her.

20
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.090 
She's worried that her sons might end up
facing the same challenges.

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.050 
She even tells her psychiatrist about her
thoughts of ending her life, which

22
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.790 
worries him.

23
00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.810 
What worries Sonia?

24
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.370
