1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.800 
However.

2
00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.980 
I wanted to join the meeting, however, I

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.160 
was caught in traffic .On the other hand.

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.020 
He likes working alone, on the other

5
00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.620 
hand, teamwork is often required in this role.

6
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.020 
Nonetheless.

7
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.880 
She was exhausted, nonetheless, she
continued working.

8
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.240 
Nevertheless.

9
00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.560 
It was raining heavily, nevertheless,

10
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.100 
they went for a walk.

11
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.980 
Despite this.

12
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.540 
He had little experience.

13
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.820 
Despite this, he was given the project.

14
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.740 
In contrast.

15
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.160 
The city is always bustling, in contrast

16
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.280 
to the quiet countryside.

17
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.260 
Even so.

18
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.720 
It was a long day, even so, he went out
to dinner with friends.

19
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.300 
Alternatively.

20
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.300 
You can go by train, alternatively, there

21
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.240 
is a bus service.

22
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.760 
While.

23
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.500 
She enjoys reading while he prefers
watching movies.

24
00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.900 
Whereas.

25
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.280 
Some prefer a steady routine, whereas

26
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.740 
others thrive on change.

27
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.180 
Yet.

28
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.840 
It's a simple idea, yet it's hard to execute.

29
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.640 
Conversely.

30
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.060 
The south experiences a wet season,
conversely, the north is usually dry.

31
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:17.420 
Although.

32
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.660 
Although he was tired, he decided to

33
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.560 
finish the report.

34
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.240 
Even though.

35
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.260 
Even though she knew the answer, she
hesitated to respond.

36
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.380 
Be that as it may.

37
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.680 
Be that as it may, we still need a solution.

38
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.900 
At the same time.

39
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.640 
I was thrilled to get the job, at the

40
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
same time, I felt nervous about the new role.

41
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.980 
On the contrary.

42
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.580 
I thought it would be difficult, on the
contrary, it was quite simple.

43
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.460 
In spite of.

44
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.700 
In spite of the challenges, she excelled

45
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.320 
in her role.

46
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.120 
Rather than.

47
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940 
He chose to relax rather than work on his project.

48
00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.400 
Nonetheless.

49
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.260 
The project faced many challenges,
nonetheless, it was completed on time.

50
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.720 
Regardless.

51
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.100 
She decided to continue with her plan,

52
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.700 
regardless of the difficulties.

53
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
In any case.

54
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.160 
We might be late, but in any case, we'll
try to get there as soon as possible.

55
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.600 
Albeit.

56
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.140 
The company reported a profit, albeit a

57
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.800 
small one.

58
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.020 
Though.

59
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.420 
He worked hard, though he was not feeling well.

60
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.500 
While this may be true.

61
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.620 
While this may be true, there are other
factors to consider.

62
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:37.540 
Contrary to.

63
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.020 
Contrary to popular belief, not all cats

64
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.900 
dislike water.

65
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.540 
Whereas.

66
00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.480 
John loves hiking, whereas his brother
prefers cycling.

67
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.340 
In comparison.

68
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.780 
In comparison to last year, this year's

69
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.340 
sales have increased significantly.

70
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.900 
Despite.

71
00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.380 
She achieved great results despite facing
many obstacles.

72
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.060 
Therefore.

73
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.820 
The weather forecast predicts rain,

74
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.040 
therefore, the event has been postponed.

75
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.000 
As a result.

76
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.980 
She studied hard for weeks, as a result,
she passed the exam.

77
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.740 
Consequently.

78
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.060 
The team failed to meet the deadline and,

79
00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.280 
consequently, lost the contract.

80
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.760 
Hence.

81
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.080 
He forgot his keys at home, hence, he was
locked out.

82
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.440 
Thus.

83
00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.920 
They didn't prepare for the meeting,

84
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.680 
thus, it was less productive.

85
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.480 
Due to.

86
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.880 
So that.

87
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.960 
He studied extra hours so that he could

88
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.880 
pass the exam.

89
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.480 
Owing to.

90
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.100 
Owing to the high demand, the product
sold out quickly.

91
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.100 
In order to.

92
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.320 
She saved money in order to buy a new car.

93
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.180 
Accordingly.

94
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.460 
The market shifted and, accordingly, they

95
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.580 
adjusted their strategy.

96
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.460 
That's why.

97
00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.000 
She missed her bus, that's why she was late.

98
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.960 
On account of.

99
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.060 
They stayed indoors on account of the storm.

100
00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.120 
With this in mind.

101
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.160 
The team prioritized efficiency, with
this in mind when designing the project.

102
00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.160 
For this purpose.

103
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.260 
They hired a specialist for this purpose.

104
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.120 
To this end.

105
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.860 
To this end, they allocated more

106
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.200 
resources to research.

107
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.920 
In consequence.

108
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.880 
In consequence of his actions, he was promoted.

109
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.920 
Resulting in.

110
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.240 
Resulting in road closures.

111
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:50.080 
Because of.

112
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.360 
They canceled the picnic because of the rain.

113
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.380 
In light of this.

114
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.660 
In light of this information, we should
reconsider our approach.

115
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:01.620 
For instance.

116
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.880 
Some animals are quite intelligent, for

117
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.520 
instance, dolphins can learn complex tasks.

118
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.360 
For example.

119
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.400 
To illustrate.

120
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.660 
To illustrate this point, consider the

121
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.660 
following scenario.

122
00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:23.600 
Such as.

123
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:27.600 
She enjoys outdoor activities such as
hiking and biking.

124
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.760 
As an illustration.

125
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.800 
As an illustration, think of a tree

126
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.060 
growing towards the light.

127
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.840 
In particular.

128
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.700 
He enjoys classical music, in particular,
the works of Mozart.

129
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.320 
Including.

130
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.560 
Biking, hiking, and birdwatching.

131
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.980 
Namely.

132
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.120 
Three cities were chosen, mainly New

133
00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.740 
York, London, and Tokyo.

134
00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:55.400 
Specifically.

135
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.560 
She was looking for specifically designed
shoes for running.

136
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:01.440 
In the case of.

137
00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.240 
In the case of an emergency, please

138
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:05.800 
follow the evacuation plan.

139
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:07.900 
Consider the following.

140
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.080 
Consider the following example to better
understand the concept.

141
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.380 
Take, for example, the way technology has
changed communication.

142
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.740 
A prime example is.

143
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.840 
A prime example is the rapid rise of

144
00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.840 
smartphone usage.

145
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:27.800 
As seen in.

146
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.980 
The effectiveness of this strategy is
evident, as seen in last quarter's results.

147
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.260 
This can be seen in.

148
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.940 
This can be seen in the way they approach

149
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:38.700 
their projects.

150
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.000 
By way of illustration.

151
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:48.360 
This is illustrated by.

152
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.060 
This is illustrated by the number of

153
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.260 
successful projects completed last year.

154
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.320 
To give an example.

155
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.580 
To give an example, she cited several
successful companies.

156
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.800 
One example is.

157
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.240 
One example is the impact of education on

158
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.100 
community health.

159
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.000 
In this case.

160
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.260 
In this case, we should proceed with caution.

161
00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.680 
Moreover.

162
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.180 
Furthermore.

163
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.520 
She has strong communication skills,

164
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.920 
furthermore, she is an excellent team player.

165
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.540 
In addition.

166
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.160 
In addition to his role, he also
volunteers with local charities.

167
00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.540 
Besides.

168
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.760 
She is very talented, besides, she is dedicated.

169
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:38.840 
As well as.

170
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.960 
The event includes workshops as well as

171
00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:42.960 
networking sessions.

172
00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:44.820 
Along with.

173
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.500 
Along with his regular duties, he also
manages the team's budget.

174
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:51.320 
And also.

175
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.680 
He studied law and also worked part -time.

176
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.160 
Likewise.

177
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.040 
The new policy affects students,

178
00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.180 
likewise, it impacts teachers.

179
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.500 
Plus.

180
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.420 
The job is interesting, plus it offers
great benefits.

181
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:08.180 
Similarly.

182
00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:12.000 
Similarly, both species share common features.

183
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.000 
She is very gracious, what´s more, it´s
close to public transportation.

184
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.440 
Not only, but also.

185
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:24.560 
She is not only intelligent, but also

186
00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.300 
very kind.

187
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.400 
Equally important.

188
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.200 
Equally important is the need for
community involvement.

189
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.440 
In the same vein.

190
00:08:33.910 --> 00:08:36.560 
In the same vein, other studies support

191
00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.280 
these findings.

192
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.260 
Together with.

193
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.060 
She works together with her team to
achieve their goals.

194
00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.600 
Additionally.

195
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.800 
Additionally, they plan to launch a new

196
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.000 
product next quarter.

197
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:50.980 
On top of that.

198
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.600 
The restaurant is affordable, on top of
that, the food is excellent.

199
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.780 
Plus the fact that.

200
00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:00.860 
The program is appealing, plus the fact

201
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.560 
that it´s free.

202
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.600 
Correspondingly.

203
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.540 
The budget increased, and
correspondingly, so did the scope of the project.

204
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:10.340 
Apart from.

205
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.960 
Apart from his studies, he also plays the violin.

206
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:19.780 
In conclusion, the results of the study
are promising.

207
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:25.340 
To sum up, we recommend continuing the project.

208
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.860 
In summary, the benefits far outweigh the costs.

209
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.980 
All in all, it was a successful event.

210
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.980 
Ultimately, the decision is up to you.

211
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.640 
In the end, everything turned out well.

212
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.480 
As can be seen from the data, sales have increased.

213
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.420 
To wrap up, let´s review the main points.

214
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:01.380 
To bring it all together, we should

215
00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.740 
consider every option.

216
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:07.500 
Overall, the team performed well.

217
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.340 
It was a productive meeting.

218
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.820 
Taking everything into account, we

219
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.900 
believe this is the best course of action.

220
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.260 
Thus, we should proceed with the plan.

221
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:35.820 
As a final point, remember to submit your
reports by Monday.

222
00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:41.300 
All things considered, it´s been a good year.

223
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:51.980 
In essence, we aim to provide quality service.

224
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.340 
To conclude, we´ve seen significant improvements.

225
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.320 
Finally, let´s discuss the next steps.

226
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.640 
First, let´s review the objectives.

227
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.680 
Next, we need to confirm the details.

228
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.000 
Then, we´ll proceed with the plan.

229
00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:29.800 
After that, we´ll conduct a review.

230
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.440 
Subsequently, the team analyzed the results.

231
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.200 
Meanwhile, the kids were playing outside,

232
00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.400 
meanwhile, the adults prepared dinner.

233
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.160 
In the meantime, the report is being

234
00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:59.600 
finalized, in the meantime, let´s review
the previous findings.

235
00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:06.280 
At the same time, she was studying for
her exams, at the same time, she worked

236
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.940 
part -time.

237
00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.500 
Simultaneously, the fireworks exploded in

238
00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.700 
the sky and music played simultaneously
in the background.

239
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:21.640 
Seguido de esto, seguimos con la agenda actualizada.

240
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:24.900 
Antes, antes de salir, asegúrate de

241
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.780 
activar las luces.

242
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.900 
Después, tuvimos una cena y después

243
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.040 
fuimos a caminar.

244
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.320 
Al final, tras muchas detenciones, el

245
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:36.420 
proyecto fue finalizado.

246
00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:41.260 
Antes, ella llegó antes de lo esperado,

247
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.540 
sorprendiendo a todos.

248
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.460 
Tras semanas de esfuerzo duro, finalmente

249
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:48.800 
completó el proyecto.

250
00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.420 
Al llegar, el programa ya había comenzado.

251
00:12:55.710 --> 00:13:02.540 
Si, si llueve mañana, tendremos que
cancelar el desayuno, a menos que no

252
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:09.720 
logres, a menos que intentes, a menos que
puedas salir, a menos que tú termines tu

253
00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:10.500 
trabajo en casa primero.

254
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:31.480 
A pesar de que el tiempo es bueno, vamos

255
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:41.320 
a caminar, a pesar de que te ayudaré a
mantener tu promesa, a pesar de que tiene

256
00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:43.440 
la experiencia, debería liderar el proyecto.

257
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.720 
En caso de que todavía no tenga la

258
00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:45.720 
experiencia, debería liderar el proyecto.

259
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:52.740 
En caso de que ganes la lotería, ¿qué

260
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:53.740 
harías con el dinero?

261
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.860 
En caso de que el desayuno se cancele, yo

262
00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.980 
notificaré a todos.

263
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:04.420 
Si no, tenemos que salir ahora, si no,

264
00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:05.500 
seríamos tardes.

265
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:20.480 
Si no, podemos ir al parque, si no,

266
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.200 
podemos quedarnos en casa y ver un película.

267
00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.420 
En caso de que puedas estar tardes en

268
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:32.460 
caso de que me llames cuando llegues a
casa, a pesar de que te daré el libro, a

269
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.180 
pesar de que lo devuelvas la próxima semana.

270
00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.620 
Si es así, déjame saber si estás

271
00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:40.260 
interesado, si es así, puedo dar tí más detalles.

272
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.980 
Creo que todos merecen una segunda oportunidad.

273
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.760 
En mi opinión, el trabajo de equipo es
esencial para el éxito.

274
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.200 
Personalmente, prefiero trabajar en un
ambiente tranquilo.

275
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:08.500 
En mi mente, la decisión fue un error.

276
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.400 
Pienso que la comunicación es clave para

277
00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.420 
una relación saludable.

278
00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:26.160 
En cuanto a mí, este tema necesita

279
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.980 
atención inmediata.

280
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.640 
Pienso que la educación es la fundación

281
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:33.360 
de la sociedad.

282
00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:38.120 
Me parece que estamos avanzando.

283
00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.140 
Estoy convencida de que el trabajo duro
lleva a éxito.

284
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.860 
Creo que deberíamos tratar una estrategia diferente.

285
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.580 
A mi conocimiento, el proyecto está disponible.

286
00:15:55.990 --> 00:16:00.440 
En mi opinión, todos deberían tener
acceso a salud de calidad.

287
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.880 
Mi impresión es que la empresa está
siendo más confiada.

288
00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.860 
Creo fuertemente en la importancia de la
consciencia de la salud mental.

289
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.740 
En mi opinión, tenemos que centrarnos en
prácticas sostenibles.

290
00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:31.580 
Me sorprende que no hemos considerado
todas las opciones.

291
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:38.280 
Estoy de la opinión de que la
colaboración promueve la innovación.

292
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:40.600 
Es mi firme creencia.

293
00:16:41.150 --> 00:16:43.320 
Es mi firme creencia de que la amabilidad

294
00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.160 
tiene un largo camino.

295
00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.660 
Algunos dicen que las redes sociales

296
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:50.660 
pueden ser detrimentales a la salud mental.

297
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.460 
Algunos dicen que los beneficios de la

298
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.060 
tecnología afectan a los riesgos.

299
00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:02.020 
Hay una escuela de pensamiento que

300
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.420 
enfatiza el papel de la naturaleza en la educación.

301
00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:09.380 
Los críticos dicen que la nueva política

302
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.660 
podría dañar al ambiente.

303
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.040 
Los oponentes creen que los cambios

304
00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:24.280 
impactarán negativamente a los pequeños negocios.
