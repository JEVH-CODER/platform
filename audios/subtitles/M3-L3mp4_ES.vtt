1
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.620 
Pretty good, excellent, excellent.

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.600 
So, the first phrase, the first phrase we have.

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.240 
Can I have three sandwiches please?

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.160 
Can I have three sandwiches please?

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.740 
Entonces, three sandwiches, okay?

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.040 
Sandwiches.

7
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.440 
So, repeat it for me.

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.740 
Can I have three sandwiches please?

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.820 
Pretty good, once more.

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.680 
Can I have three sandwiches please?

11
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.440 
Excellent, nice, nice.

12
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.680 
So, check out this video and tell me how

13
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.600 
many sandwiches of these ones can you eat?

14
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140 
Mira el video de este sandwich y dime

15
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.280 
cuántos de estos crees que tú te podrías comer.

16
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.700 
Known as torta in Mexico.

17
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.920 
Thousands of pieces of bread, lettuce,
onion and tomato were mixed with dozens

18
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.660 
of ingredients, including hundreds of
litres of mayonnaise, mustard and spicy sauces.

19
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.820 
However, despite its super size, the
sandwich didn't quite make it into the

20
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.060 
big league of sandwiches.

21
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.140 
According to the Guinness Book of World

22
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.680 
Records, the largest sandwich ever made
was in America back in 2005 and it

23
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.900 
weighed nearly 6 ,000 pounds.

24
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.620 
The long torture challenge is part of a

25
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.700 
five -day fair that looks to support the
traditional Mexican sandwich.

26
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.180 
The next one, of course, here you are.

27
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.840 
Of course, here you are.

28
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
So, here you are, lo utilizas para
entregarle algo a alguien.

29
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.880 
Listo, entonces, por ejemplo, estás en el
restaurant y le pides al mesero.

30
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.660 
Can I have three sandwiches, please?

31
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.640 
El mesero te dice, of course, here you

32
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.160 
are y te entrega los sandwiches, ok?

33
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.100 
Say it with me.

34
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.960 
Of course, here you are.

35
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.920 
Pretty good, excellent.

36
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.200 
One more, once more.

37
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.200 
Of course, here you are.

38
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.440 
Here you are, ok?

39
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.360 
Here you are.

40
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.240 
Excelente.

41
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.920 
Mira los clips.

42
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.820 
Here you are, sir.

43
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.120 
Sir.

44
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.340 
Here you are, sir.

45
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.600 
Sir.

46
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.340 
How many cookies do you want?

47
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.460 
How many cookies do you want?

48
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.520 
Recuerda que how many es cuantos.

49
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.940 
Muy bien.

50
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.320 
How many cookies do you want?

51
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.940 
How many cookies do you want?

52
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.720 
¿Cuántas cookies quieres?

53
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.680 
También te pueden decir, how many do you want?

54
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.280 
Si, por ejemplo, pediste, I want cookies.

55
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.600 
Si dijiste, quiero cookies.

56
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.620 
Y entonces te preguntan, how many?

57
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.360 
¿Cuántas?

58
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.900 
Ok?

59
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.960 
How many do you want?

60
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.640 
¿Cuántas quieres?

61
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.100 
So, how many cookies do you want?

62
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.820 
Say it with me.

63
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.160 
Repeat.

64
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.560 
How many cookies do you want?

65
00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.070 
Excellent.

66
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.550 
Pretty good.

67
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.090 
Once more.

68
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.630 
How many cookies do you want?

69
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.800 
Pretty good.

70
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:17.240 
Excellent.

71
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.660 
Excellent.

72
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:20.880 
Now, escúcha el clip.

75
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.260 
Three cookies, please.

76
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.500 
You?

77
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.080 
Once again, say it with me.

78
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.300 
Three cookies, please.

79
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.660 
Excellent.

80
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.300 
Nice.

81
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.680 
Nice.

82
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.480 
So, remember something.

83
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.120 
Recuerda, mistakes are proof that you are
trying and learning.

84
00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.320 
Los errores son prueba de que tú estás
tratando, que lo estás intentando y que

85
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.060 
lo estás logrando, que estás aprendiendo.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.380 
Darle la valoración a la clase.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.620 
I'll see you in the next one.

Bye -bye.
