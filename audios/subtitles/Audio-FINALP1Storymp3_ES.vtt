1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.560 
Johnny is walking down the street.

2
00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:03.660 
He just got off work and is going to

3
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.220 
visit a neighbor who's under the weather.

4
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.040 
To get to his sick friend's house, he has

5
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.800 
to cross a dark and lonely alley.

6
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.600 
There have been stories about people

7
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.480 
getting mugged in that very alley.

8
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.380 
Johnny doesn't want to go through there,

9
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.860 
but he promised his wife he'd take the
miracle soup to the ailing old man.

10
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.100 
Johnny finally bites the bullet and goes
through the alley.

11
00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.900 
Just as he's about to reach the house,
he's intercepted by a hooded man.

12
00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.740 
Johnny starts to sweat bullets.

13
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.920 
The man asks, How are you?

14
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.680 
How's it going?

15
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.500 
Johnny is surprised.

16
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.680 
This is a polite robber, he thinks.

17
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.580 
He responds, Very well, thank God.

18
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.160 
The robber then asks, Where do you live?

19
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.620 
Do you live in that house at the end?

20
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
Out of fear that the man might think he's
a spy, Johnny says yes

21
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.000 
.

22
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
The man gives him a beating for lying.

23
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.760 
The man knew Johnny didn't live there.

24
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.440 
This hooded man was the son of the sick

25
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.380 
old man
.

26
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.360 
He was trying to guard his dad from
scoundrels, who would love to rob him.

27
00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:57.640 
God bless you, Johnny.

28
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.640 
Legal교wan, he's on Jean Neck.

29
00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:58.200 
If I was younger, I want to take...

30
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.200 
I don't know.
