Chapter 3.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.040 
The Successful Politician.

8
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.800 
Early Beginnings.

9
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.100 
In 2015, Dr. Ben Carson, celebrated for
his groundbreaking work as a

10
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.920 
neurosurgeon, ventured into the political
arena with the aim of securing the

11
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.580 
Republican nomination for President of
the United States.

12
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.840 
He smelled the opportunity in the air, nevertheless.

13
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.120 
Not once did he underestimate the

14
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.340 
challenges he would face in this highly
competitive race.

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.000 
One could feel it was going to be
extremely tough, because he would have to

16
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.660 
compete against candidates such as Donald
Trump, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz.

17
00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.920 
Controversial Issues.

18
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.540 
Dr. Carson had strong and clear opinions

19
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.700 
on controversial issues.

20
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.720 
On abortion, he was firmly pro -life,

21
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.000 
advocating for the protection of unborn children.

22
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.900 
He believed that life begins at

23
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.620 
conception and opposed abortion, except
in cases where the mother's life was at risk.

24
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.880 
On drug policy, Carson supported a tough
stance on illegal drugs, but also

25
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.700 
emphasized the importance of addressing
addiction through rehabilitation, rather

26
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.380 
than solely through punitive measures.

27
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.440 
Campaign Events.

28
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.380 
As the campaign progressed, Dr. Carson
was often seen at various events,

29
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.620 
delivering speeches and participating in debates.

30
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.860 
He used to emphasize his outsider

31
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.220 
perspective and medical expertise, hoping
to appeal to voters who valued these traits.

32
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.460 
Dr. Carson would often reflect on his
experiences as a neurosurgeon during his campaign.

33
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.400 
He saw that the competition was fierce,
setbacks and withdrawal.

34
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.740 
In March 2016, following a disappointing
Super Tuesday performance, Carson decided

35
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:47.920 
to suspend his campaign.

36
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.740 
His decision was influenced by the

37
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.980 
realization that he was unlikely to
secure the nomination, due to his

38
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.500 
inability to compete effectively against
his better funded and more politically

39
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.240 
connected rivals.

40
00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.580 
After all, he had been a neurosurgeon all

41
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.700 
his life and not a politician like the others.

42
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.980 
Never had he faced such a challenging

43
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.920 
political environment.

44
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.480 
And so he tasted the bitterness of defeat

45
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.260 
early in the race.

46
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

47
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.480 
In 2017, Dr. Carson got appointed as the
Secretary of Housing and Urban

48
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.340 
Development HUD by President Donald Trump.

49
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.080 
There were speculations about how Carson

50
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.820 
might get another chance to run for
office again in the future, whether as a

51
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.760 
senator or in another significant role.

52
00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.860 
His political career, characterized by

53
00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.360 
how he got to transition from a renowned
neurosurgeon to a public servant

54
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.160 
, showcased how he got used to his new
role and the challenges it brought

55
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.560 
.

56
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
This transition showed how Dr. Carson got

57
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.720 
to adapt and thrive in a completely
different field, demonstrating his

58
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.920 
versatility and commitment to public service.
