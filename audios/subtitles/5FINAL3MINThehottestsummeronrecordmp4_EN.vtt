00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080 
In Climate Watch, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration has

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.900 
released its State of the Climate report
for August.

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.540 
The data shows that this summer was more
than two degrees above normal, making it

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
one of the warmest ever on record.

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.880 
The report also found the amount of

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
climate disasters that occurred in the
United States this summer was abnormal.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.440 
For more, I want to bring in CBS News
Meteorologist and Climate Specialist,

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.240 
Jeff Berardelli.

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.840 
Jeff, the report says this summer is tied

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.880 
with a Dust Bowl summer of 1936.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.280 
How significant is that?

12
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.760 
Very significant.

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.400 
That was an extraordinarily hot summer

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.480 
and it was man -made.

15
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.600 
The reason why it was so hot was caused

16
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
by humans.

17
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.380 
Farmers had gotten rid of all the native

18
00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.160 
grass because a lot of the farmers that
were moving into that area during that

19
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.520 
time didn't have a lot of experience farming.

20
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.620 
So they wiped out all the native grass

21
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.280 
and just left dirt behind.

22
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.040 
And that dirt would absorb a lot of the

23
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.280 
sun's rays and really, really heat it up.

24
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.020 
And also, it created tremendous dust

25
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.820 
storms, which in many cases were deadly
dust storms.

26
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.920 
So let's talk about what happened this
summer and we'll talk about 1936 as well.

27
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
So for June, July and August, it was the
hottest on record across the West and one

28
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.240 
of the hottest on record in the Upper
Midwest and in the Northeast.

29
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.520 
And it beat out the summer of 1936 by a
sliver, so it's the hottest summer on record.

30
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.900 
You can see temperatures were about 5
degrees above normal across the West.

31
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.720 
But
slightly below normal here near the Gulf Coast.

32
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.900 
That's because it was very rainy and this
is what climate change does, right?

33
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.700 
It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

34
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.180 
And what I mean by that is, where places

35
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.580 
that typically see a lot of rain, they
got more rain.

36
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
Places like Mississippi and Alabama was
the wettest on record for them.

37
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.460 
And that wet air and all that rainfall
extended to the Great Lakes and

38
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.440 
Northeast, where we already have a
surplus of rain typically.

39
00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.000 
But across the plains states and most
parts of the West, it was generally a

40
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.480 
fairly dry summer.

41
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.580 
The exception to that was an exceptional

42
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.580 
monsoon in Arizona, where it rained a lot actually.

43
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.360 
Areas of Mississippi and Alabama had 10

44
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.980 
inches above their normal rain for the summer.

45
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.320 
It caused a lot of flooding up and down

46
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.480 
the eastern seaboard.

47
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.240 
So, this was the Dust Bowl summer of 1936.

48
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.840 
You notice that temperatures got above
110 degrees across such a large part of

49
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.660 
the country in the plains states into the
Midwest as well.

50
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.220 
In fact, this is an incredible,
incredible stat when you think about it.

51
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.500 
25 % of all heat records in our record,
which goes back 100 -150 years, they were

52
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.820 
broken in that one year.

53
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.380 
That's how hot it was in 1936.

54
00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.860 
And you can see, we saw extreme heat 40
-50 days or so.

55
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.080 
And again, the reason for that was also
man -made.

56
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.200 
This time, it's a different type of man
-made climate change.

57
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.160 
It's greenhouse gases which are trapping
the heat, which is caused by the burning

58
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.300 
of fossil fuels.

59
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.980 
But either way, it was a disaster.

60
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.440 
That was a disaster year, and we've seen
a lot of disasters so far this year.
