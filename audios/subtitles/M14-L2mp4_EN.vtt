00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.890 
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.190 
Welcome to this new lesson.

3
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.190 
Listen to the clip.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.430 
What's your favorite color?

5
00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.020 
Red.

6
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.780 
Lie.

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.290 
So the very first phrase, what's your name?

8
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.070 
Sorry.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.930 
What's your favorite color?

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.690 
The very first phrase, what's your

11
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.410 
favorite color?

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.650 
What's your favorite color?

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.830 
What's your favorite color?

14
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.130 
What's your favorite color?

15
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.990 
You say it with me?

16
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.350 
You?

17
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.350 
Pretty good.

18
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.690 
Excellent.

19
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.330 
Once more.

20
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.410 
What's your favorite color?

21
00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:41.230 
Nice.

22
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
So, what's your favorite color?

23
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.590 
Here are some answers.

24
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.930 
I don't have a specific favorite, but I

25
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.110 
like red.

26
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.810 
It's vibrant.

27
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.010 
So, I don't have a specific favorite, but
I like red.

28
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.630 
It's vibrant.

29
00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.850 
No tengo un favorito específico, pero me

30
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.510 
gusta el rojo.

31
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.190 
Es vibrante.

32
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.850 
Okay?

33
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.230 
So, I don't have a specific favorite, but

34
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.070 
I like red.

35
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.190 
It's vibrant.

36
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.470 
I don't have a specific favorite, but I
like red.

37
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
It's vibrant.

38
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.980 
Pretty good.

39
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.400 
Excellent.

40
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.820 
Excellent.

41
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.760 
One more time.

42
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.740 
So, the next one is, I prefer green.

43
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.140 
I prefer green.

44
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.700 
Okay?

45
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.520 
Say it with me.

46
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:38.640 
I prefer green.

47
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.150 
Pretty good.

48
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.470 
Again.

49
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.790 
I prefer green.

50
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.210 
Nice.

51
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.610 
Excellent.

52
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.650 
I don't like to discuss personal matters

53
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.010 
at work.

54
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.310 
No me gusta discutir cosas personales o

55
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.490 
asuntos personales en el trabajo.

56
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.390 
Okay?

57
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.630 
So, I don't like to discuss personal
matters at work.

58
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.530 
I don't like to discuss personal matters
at work.

59
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.090 
You?

60
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.060 
Pretty good.

61
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.420 
Excellent.

62
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.180 
One more time.

63
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.060 
I don't like to discuss personal matters
at work.

64
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.220 
Pretty good.

65
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.240 
So, now I have a question for you.

66
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.880 
There's some people that think, or
there's people, perhaps there are a lot,

67
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.280 
or perhaps there are a few, people that
think that your personal ethic has

68
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.840 
nothing to do, your personal moral ethic
has nothing to do with your work, with

69
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.540 
your job, what you do, you know, what you
do for a living.

70
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.360 
So, what do you think about that?

71
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.320 
Is that right?

72
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.140 
Yes?

73
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.700 
No?

74
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.340 
Why?

75
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.000 
Why not?

76
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:49.000 
Okay?

77
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.640 
So, check out in the comments below.

78
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.740 
Tell me what you think about that.

79
00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.340 
Okay?

80
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.780 
So, lo que estaba diciendo es que hay
personas que creen que, o muchas, puede

81
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:06.200 
ser muchas, puede ser pocas, personas que
creen que su moral, ética personal, no

82
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.560 
tiene nada que ver con la ética laboral
que tienen.

83
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.380 
Okay?

84
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.320 
So, quiero saber.

85
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.940 
Tell me in English, in the comments, in English.

86
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.620 
Do you think that's right?

87
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:15.680 
¿Piensas que está bien?

88
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.880 
¿O piensas que está mal?

89
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.820 
¿Por qué sí?

90
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:18.300 
¿Por qué no?

91
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.700 
I will read the comments down below.

92
00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.460 
So, I don't like to discuss personal

93
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.620 
matters at work.

94
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.780 
The next one.

95
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.940 
We're going to check out some videos.

96
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.120 
Vamos a ver algunos videos.

97
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.920 
Y tú vas a decir, de acuerdo con los
videos, puedes decir las siguientes frases.

98
00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:35.660 
La primera.

99
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:36.780 
I don't like it.

100
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.600 
No me gusta.

101
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.780 
I don't like it.

102
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.380 
I don't like it.

103
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.950 
Pretty good.

104
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.390 
Excellent.

105
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.810 
Excellent.

106
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.770 
The second.

107
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.790 
I like it.

108
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.190 
Pretty good.

109
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.470 
Nice.

110
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.070 
Or, I love it.

111
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.320 
I love it.

112
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.820 
Pretty good.

113
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.220 
Nice.

114
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.540 
Nice.

115
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.040 
So, dependiendo del video y de lo que tú

116
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.920 
pienses, puedes decir I like it.

117
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.120 
I love it.

118
00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.100 
Or, I don't like it.

119
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.380 
So, check out the videos.

120
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.180 
Mira los videos.

121
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:06.580 
Cheesecake ramen.

122
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.480 
I gotta try it out.

123
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.560 
Maybe it will taste really good.

124
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.840 
Okay, I'm ready.

125
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.380 
It's a little bit spicy.

126
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.360 
The texture of the noodle is so good.

127
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.120 
Some pork.

128
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.960 
Some cheesecake.

129
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.840 
Shot cake.

130
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.880 
The cake is really good on its own.

131
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.400 
Now, I'm going to eat it together.

132
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.660 
No.

133
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.700 
This is so strange.

134
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.060 
It's pretty weird.

135
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.380 
I don't think it tastes good together.

136
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.940 
I decided to mix it in and it tasted so
much better.

137
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.140 
So, would you try this?

138
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.320 
Let me know in the comments.

139
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.500 
The mistakes are proofs that you're
trying and that you're learning, okay?

140
00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:58.420 
Recuerda que los errores son la prueba de
que tú estás intentando y de que estás aprendiendo.

141
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.320 
So, keep on going with that.

142
00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.360 
Remember to comment the class and rate

143
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:02.920 
the class.

144
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.460 
And what we achieved today were 36 words,

145
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.600 
8 phrases, and we developed vocabulary,
speaking, and listening.

146
00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
Congratulations and bye -bye.

147
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.660 
See ya.
