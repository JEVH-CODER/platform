1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.860 
we wanted to explore what makes a family.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.820 
We brought together seven families for

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.000 
the biggest cast of Odd Man Out yet.

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.780 
And we are a family.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.100 
We are a family.

6
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
We're a family.

7
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.740 
We are a family.

8
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.280 
We are a family.

9
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.700 
And we're a family.

10
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.980 
And we are a family.

11
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.080 
One is a liar.

12
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.300 
If the group discovers who the liar is,

13
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.680 
they'll split a cash prize.

14
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.820 
If the liar remains, they'll win the cash prize.

15
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.860 
This is Odd Man Out.

16
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.810 
And I'm Ryan.

17
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.430 
And we're from Orange County, California.

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.490 
Are you guys excited?

19
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.510 
Uh, yeah.

20
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.230 
Heck yeah.

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.690 
To win this thing.

22
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
I'm Iris.

23
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.700 
Iris, I'm Liberty.

24
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.340 
And we are family.

25
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.460 
We live in Anchorage, Alaska.

26
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.980 
So we're gonna rely heavily on our

27
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.520 
intuition, ask a lot of questions.

28
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.940 
Hi, I'm Tamara.

29
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.600 
And we are from London.

30
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.900 
And we are...

31
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.240 
The family.

32
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.500 
Lux.

33
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.700 
It's honestly my favorite YouTube show,
so I'm pretty excited to be part of it.

34
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.520 
And she dragged me into it.

35
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.740 
The truth will come out easy.

36
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.800 
Yeah, if they're nervous around each other.

37
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.720 
My name is Emily.

38
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.500 
My name is Chris.

39
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.680 
And we're twins.

40
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.320 
Fraternal.

41
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.180 
Rat twins.

42
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.340 
Ew.

43
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.220 
Hi, I'm Jacqueline.

44
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.080 
I'm Jayda.

45
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.020 
I'm Jordan.

46
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.720 
I'm Raj.

47
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.840 
And I'm Huey.

48
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.900 
We got to analyze everyone.

49
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.460 
Hi, my name is Phu.

50
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
Hi, my name is Lynn.

51
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.800 
So the strategy that we are planning to

52
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.540 
use is to look at people's body language
and looking for answers that are generic

53
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.400 
and there is no uniqueness in them.

54
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.840 
I think we're gonna catch who the mole is

55
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.360 
pretty soon.
