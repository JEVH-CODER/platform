1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.660 
President -elect Donald Trump is expected
to name Stephen Miller as White House

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.840 
deputy chief of staff for policy.

3
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.240 
Miller is Trump's top immigration advisor.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.340 
He is a lead architect of Trump's plans
for mass deportation of undocumented

5
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.880 
immigrants, and he has said that a second
Trump administration would seek a tenfold

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.820 
increase in the number of deportations to
more than one million per year.

7
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.720 
Joining us now for more on this is former
Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jay Johnson.

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.760 
He is also a partner at Paul Weiss.

9
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.460 
Nice to see you.

10
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.340 
Thanks for your time.

11
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.680 
So Stephen Miller, as I noted, is seen as

12
00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.180 
an architect of Trump's mass deportation plan.

13
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.280 
What is your reaction to this news?

14
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.920 
Pam, any administration in the
enforcement of immigration law and policy

15
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.980 
has to have priorities.

16
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Mass deportation, the phrase mass

17
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.600 
deportation, is a bumper sticker.

18
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.820 
It's a rallying cry.

19
00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.300 
But any administration, whether it's
Trump, whether it's Biden, Obama, Bush,

20
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.140 
has to have priorities.

21
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.340 
And the priorities are the most dangerous

22
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.880 
among undocumented immigrants.

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.360 
I want to see ICRO going after the

24
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.980 
criminals, going after the national
security threats.

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.300 
When they're released from jail, turn
them straight over to ICE for deportation

26
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.160 
after they've been ordered deported from
our country.

27
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.620 
And I know Tom Holman knows that as well
because he used to work for me at DHS.

28
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.320 
So I want to follow up with you on that
because you did work with Tom Holman.

29
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.840 
Tom Holman is very anti -sanctuary cities.

30
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.840 
What you said, though, is you said, look,

31
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.940 
they should be handed over to federal
authorities in sanctuary cities.

32
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.900 
That's not typically allowed.

33
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.340 
So what do you say to that?

34
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.420 
And what do you say about Tom taking on
this role as borders are?

35
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.840 
Well, you know, I've dealt with a lot of
major cities, big city mayors when I was

36
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.020 
in office about the sanctuary city movement.

37
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.940 
And we were able to get a fair amount of

38
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.420 
traction when it came to working with
mayors saying, look, we need you to give

39
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.020 
us the most dangerous in your jails who
are undocumented for the sake of the

40
00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.840 
public safety of your own citizens.

41
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.960 
Now, Tom, I worked with a lot and he was

42
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.120 
with me when he was at ICE.

43
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.300 
He was very definitely pro enforcement.

44
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.700 
I don't recognize, frankly, the Tom
Holman I hear public speaking these days,

45
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.100 
but he does understand the hurdles and
the law.

46
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.500 
I don't understand the appointment of Tom
Holman as a border czar responsible for

47
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.080 
border security, aviation security,
maritime security.

48
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.100 
That's the job of the secretary of
Homeland Security.

49
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
That's 60 or 70 percent of the job.

50
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.460 
And it is entirely within the Department

51
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.540 
of Homeland Security.

52
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.220 
Normally, you appoint a czar to lead an

53
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.460 
interagency multi -department effort.

54
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.600 
So I have a lot of questions about this appointment.

55
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.440 
So you think, though, that the fact that
he does have operational experience and

56
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.200 
understands that complexities could be a
positive, though?

57
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
Yes, I do.

58
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.000 
Tom understands the complexities of

59
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.660 
immigration law and enforcement.

60
00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.160 
But this idea of some sort of mass

61
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.260 
deportation is, frankly, not workable.

62
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.520 
I'd much rather see ICE go after the

63
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.840 
criminals versus somebody who's been in
this country for 10 and 15 years,

64
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.680 
committed no crimes, has a small
business, and has U .S. citizen children.

65
00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.260 
These are people who are de facto Americans.

66
00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.280 
Go after the criminals.

67
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.000 
So let's talk a little bit more about
that, because, you know, you say go after

68
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.440 
the criminals.

69
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.540 
We've actually heard from J .D. Vance,

70
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.380 
for his part, right, and others close to
Trump, that that will be their overall priority.

71
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.660 
But at the same time, you're also hearing
Trump say, look, day one, we're going to

72
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.580 
focus on mass deportations.

73
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.580 
Practically, with a promise like that, I

74
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.400 
mean, how do you even do that, and how do
you do it without hurting the economy?

75
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.900 
That's a good question.

76
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.960 
First, if you're looking for people to

77
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.480 
send back, there has to be a final order
of deportation.

78
00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.660 
If the order is issued in absentia
without the person present, they're

79
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.660 
entitled to an automatic rehearing.

80
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.800 
They have to have exhausted their appeal

81
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.040 
process, and then you have to find them.

82
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.040 
And that's not a difficult process.

83
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.760 
And by the time you winnow down that
list, it's not nearly as great as you

84
00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.340 
think it is.

85
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.580 
Again, I'd much rather see ICE go after

86
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.580 
public safety threats, the criminals,
gang members, and potential national

87
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.520 
security threats.

88
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.840 
That's where the focus needs to be.

89
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.780 
That's where it's always been, including
during the previous Trump administration.

90
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.500 
Do you think that the Biden
administration was remiss in not doing

91
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.940 
that enough?

92
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.140 
No, I won't say that.

93
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.160 
I'm sure that the priorities were public
safety threats and the like, because it

94
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.900 
was the written policy of my successor,
Ali Mayorkas.

95
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.160 
It's all a question of resources, Pam.

96
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:18.600 
How much do you want to devote to this?

97
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.360 
But even if Congress gives you endless
amounts of resources, the dangerous among

98
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.900 
us have to be the priorities.

99
00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.820 
I spoke with former Trump acting DHS

100
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.020 
Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli last week
about some of the claims.

101
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.660 
He wrote the section on immigration in
Project 2025.

102
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.120 
I want to play some of what he told me
regarding what should happen with family separations.

103
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.320 
When it comes to mixed families, by that
we mean, you may, as you use the example

104
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.560 
of a citizen child and illegal parents,
the family's going to make that decision.

105
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.860 
The government isn't going to make that decision.

106
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.520 
And they'll be given the time to do that,

107
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.060 
I expect.

108
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.200 
But they're going to have to make that decision.

109
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.400 
And their earlier decisions obviously
have brought their family to the point of

110
00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.860 
having to make that future decision of
where they live and whether they live

111
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:16.880 
together or apart.

112
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.000 
And I should also note that Tom Homan on

113
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.100 
60 Minutes was asked the question, is
there a way to do this without separating families?

114
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.720 
And he said, well, you just, yeah, sure,
you deport the families together.

115
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.800 
What is your reaction to that?

116
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.400 
Pam, when I was secretary of DHS, the way

117
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:42.340 
I approached this issue is I could not
ask a border patrol agent or an ICE

118
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.460 
enforcement agent to do something I
wouldn't do myself.

119
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:53.660 
And I could not pull a father away from a
two -year -old U .S. citizen -born child

120
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.620 
at the border or someplace else.

121
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.140 
To me, that's an inhumane policy.

122
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:02.540 
Again, the priorities need to be the criminals.

123
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.620 
The priorities need to be the public

124
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.500 
safety, national security threats.

125
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:10.420 
And there are enough of them in our jails

126
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.520 
today to keep ICE very, very busy.

127
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.300 
My concern, Pam, about mass deportation,

128
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.940 
this notion of mass deportation, it's
going to turbocharge the sanctuary city

129
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:26.640 
movement in big cities such that local
law enforcement will refuse to work with

130
00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.900 
ICE in getting at the public safety threats.

131
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.780 
Jay Johnson, thank you so much.

132
00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:36.880 
So interesting to hear your perspective
as the former secretary of DHS and

133
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.820 
someone, as we know, to do work with Tom Homan.

134
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:40.620 
We really appreciate your time.

135
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:42.240 
Thank you.
