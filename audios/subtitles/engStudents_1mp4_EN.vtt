1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.500 
A modern day adventure, the school project.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.660 
Could I ask you something?

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.220 
Claudia said to her study group.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.320 
Has anyone finished the history project yet?

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.080 
As four of us sat there in silence, she
knew she had to get her act together.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760 
Every other day for the past week, we had
talked about it, but no one had gotten started.

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.440 
Well, I told myself, it's time to spill
the beans.

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.200 
I haven't even gone to the library.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.580 
Claudia, being the most organized among

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.000 
ourselves, suggested we help each other.

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
As we brainstormed, I listened carefully

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.500 
to everyone's ideas.

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.620 
Those who work together get better grades.

14
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
She explained.

15
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.460 
The project would cost an arm and a leg

16
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.900 
in effort.

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.280 
We needed to visit five different museums

18
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.360 
seven times each.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.540 
Then, inspiration came when we thought of

20
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
using our smartphones for research.

21
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.020 
How far do you think we'll need to walk?

22
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.820 
Asked Fernando.

23
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.000 
Beside the main museum, there are eight

24
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.520 
others we could check out.

25
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.820 
After visiting eight museums, we realized

26
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.630 
we had only one more left to explore.

27
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.680 
We had known this would be challenging,

28
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.680 
but to make a long story short, we needed
to stop procrastinating.

29
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.540 
We had played around with different
ideas, but couldn't decide.

30
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
Okay, so here's the plan.

31
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.340 
Claudia announced.

32
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.540 
Right now, there's an elephant in the room.

33
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.500 
None of us has taken any action yet.

34
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.240 
She was correct.

35
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.520 
We had seen the deadline approaching, but

36
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.360 
hadn't done anything.

37
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.680 
I'm not sure I follow.

38
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.980 
Said Mike.

39
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.720 
I wanted to tell them that we could use

40
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.140 
the internet for some research.

41
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.180 
Could you speak a little louder?

42
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.780 
The cafeteria was noisy with 90 students
having lunch.

43
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.820 
Excuse me?

44
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.640 
Claudia raised her voice over 20

45
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.480 
chattering freshmen.

46
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.420 
We're going to divide the work.

47
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.500 
This project is ours to conquer.

48
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.180 
Fernando, whose project outline was his

49
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.760 
to manage, would research the 1900s.

50
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.880 
The statistical data was mine to analyze.

51
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.100 
While the presentation is yours to design.

52
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.120 
She explained to Mike.

53
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.860 
The final report would be hers to write,
and the coordination was theirs to

54
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
handle, referring to our other teammates.

55
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.800 
No cap, fam.

56
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.960 
This vibe is Gucci.

57
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.620 
Exclaimed Mike, trying to sound woke.

58
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.260 
Yes.

59
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.460 
The mood is perfect for a study session.

60
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.360 
Claudia replied.

61
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.740 
Some teachers walked by, and speak of the

62
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.000 
devil, it was Karen from the history
department, known for being the strictest teacher.

63
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.060 
We decided to jump on the bandwagon of
using the new study room, which could fit

64
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.300 
30 to 40 students.

65
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.000 
I'd like to give this my best shot.

66
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.600 
Said Claudia.

67
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.540 
You do your part yourselves, and I'll do

68
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.140 
mine myself at the same time.

69
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.220 
The room had 10 computers, 600 books, and

70
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.700 
enough space for 80 people.

71
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.680 
FOMO is real.

72
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.180 
Texted our friend who couldn't come.

73
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.640 
Bet you'll wish you were here.

74
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.200 
We replied.

75
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.100 
Some students acted like simps around

76
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.600 
Claudia, who was thirsty for knowledge
and had major clout in academic circles.

77
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.840 
Her bae, who visited once a week, brought
us snacks four times a month.

78
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.720 
These resources are a dime a dozen.

79
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.000 
Fernando complained, but he was capping.

80
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.640 
The materials we found were actually
quite valuable.

81
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.560 
We gathered some hundreds and thousands
of historical data from various sources.

82
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.500 
We worked until someone said, I hope not
to sound dramatic, but we might bite off

83
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.400 
more than we can chew.

84
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.560 
I hope so, then we'll finish on time.

85
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.500 
Claudia responded.

86
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.140 
The group had played their parts well,

87
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.020 
and we had come together effectively.

88
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.020 
Past projects hadn't gone this smoothly,

89
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.880 
we were not organized then, but we are
now, and we will be even better next time.

90
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.300 
To add insult to injury, the printer
broke down after we had completed 50 pages.

91
00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.280 
Do we fix it now?

92
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.260 
Did we save everything?

93
00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:15.340 
Will we meet the deadline?

94
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
These questions needed answers.

95
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.060 
Claudia, being the best student in class,
while I was arguably the worst, calmly

96
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.140 
handled the situation.

97
00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.920 
The most important thing was that we had

98
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.740 
known what to do.

99
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.160 
These technical issues.

100
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.520 
Timing is terrible, she said.

101
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.280 
By the end of the day, we could chill

102
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.560 
knowing we had done our best.

103
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.240 
Looking at ourselves in the library's

104
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.000 
reflection, we felt proud.

105
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.080 
The children's projects from last year

106
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.860 
weren't nearly as good as ours.

107
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.680 
Claudia commented.

108
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.060 
We earned 100 points on the project, the
highest score possible.

109
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.780 
The teacher's feedback was glowing.

110
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.220 
We had truly created something

111
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.360 
remarkable, proving that together, we
could achieve anything.
