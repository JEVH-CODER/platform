1
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
I'm gonna grab a seat, man.

2
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.110 
That's my seat.

3
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.550 
That's my seat.

4
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.850 
How you doing, man?

5
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.410 
Good.

6
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.370 
Pretty good.

7
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.570 
You're four years old?

8
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.340 
Okay, had to think about it a little bit.

9
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.480 
Titus, let me ask you a question.

10
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.780 
Do you know that you have over 50 million

11
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.100 
views on YouTube?

12
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.980 
There's already over 100.

13
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.620 
Okay, you have over...

14
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.800 
But what does that say?

15
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.160 
It's all this is wrong.

16
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.120 
All this is wrong.

17
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.420 
Because it says you have over 50 million viewers.

18
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.840 
You have cleaned it up.

19
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.360 
You have over 100 million.

20
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.400 
But I...

21
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.670 
Why is it three girls in those spots?

22
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
Because in this show, we put hot chicks

23
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.110 
on the front row.

24
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.220 
But see, we got your dad.

25
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.940 
See, that's your dad over there, right?

26
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.580 
I know.

27
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.040 
I know, but see, that's the dad, and
that's the dad seat over there.

28
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.380 
Because we put him there.

29
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.330 
But I...

30
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.450 
So then he can see me better.

31
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.050 
Right.

32
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.430 
So he can see you better.

33
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.150 
All right, I'll tell you what.

34
00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.650 
I got some balls over here.

35
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.850 
And I want you to...

36
00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.570 
And over there.

37
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.350 
And...

38
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.890 
Okay, I didn't know that.

39
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.530 
I just saw the walls over here.

40
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.250 
So where are your balls?

41
00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.830 
Okay.

42
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:46.480 
And let's go see a couple of tricks.

43
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.200 
Let's go over here first.

44
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.680 
Yeah.

45
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.540 
Okay.

46
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.680 
All right, let me see this first one.

47
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.640 
I can make it up here.

48
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.140 
Okay, well, let me put you up there.

49
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.460 
I'm gonna put you up there.

50
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.920 
Hold on.

51
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.600 
And let me see.

52
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.360 
Let me get a couple of balls, because we
might need a few shots at this.

53
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.920 
But you're gonna make it.

54
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.280 
So what's your first one?

55
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.740 
You're just gonna do it, ladies and gentlemen.

56
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.100 
Titus the Magnificent.

57
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.440 
Yes, you can do it now.

58
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.980 
Okay, go ahead.

59
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.260 
What?

60
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.200 
Just help make one, buddy, so we can go down.

61
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.500 
Yeah.

62
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.240 
Titus?

63
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.520 
Titus, don't worry about the smoke.

64
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.640 
Let's just make this shot.

65
00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.580 
So what we're gonna do now is...

66
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.060 
Titus,

67
00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.360 
you're scaring me with the smoke.

68
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.100 
Just...

69
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.740 
Yeah, the smoke is gone.

70
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.060 
Okay, you ready?

71
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.020 
Are you lined up where you need...

72
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.940 
Is this thing moving?

73
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.260 
Okay, here's my shot.

74
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.260 
Okay, there it is.

75
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.620 
All right, Titus, let's go.
