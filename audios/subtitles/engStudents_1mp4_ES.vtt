00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.640 
A Modern Day Adventure, The School
Project Could I ask you something?

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.320 
Claudia said to her study group
Has anyone finished the history project yet

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.500 
?

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.700 
As four of us sat there in silence, she

5
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.680 
knew she had to get her act together
Every other day for the past week, we had

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.440 
talked about it, but no one had gotten started
Well I told myself It's time to spill the

7
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:33.160 
beans I haven't even gone to the library
Claudia, being the most organized among

8
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
ourselves, suggested we help each other
As we brainstormed, I listened carefully

9
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.800 
to everyone's ideas
Those who work together get better grades

10
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.520 
She explained The project would cost an
arm and a leg in effort

11
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.940 
We needed to visit five different museums
seven times each

12
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.920 
Then
,

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.660 
inspiration came when we thought of using
our smartphones for research

14
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.000 
How far do you think we'll need to walk
? Asked Fernando Beside the main museum,

15
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.360 
there are eight others
we could check out

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.700 
After visiting eight museums, we realized
we had only one more left to explore

17
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.700 
We had known this would be challenging,
but to make a long story short, we needed

18
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.620 
to stop procrastinating We had played
around with different ideas, but couldn't

19
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:28.520 
decide Okay, so here's the plan Claudia
announced Right now, there's an elephant

20
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.260 
in the room
None of us has taken any action yet

21
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.400 
She was correct
We had seen the deadline approaching, but

22
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.600 
hadn't done anything I'm not sure
I follow Said Mike

23
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.660 
I wanted to tell them that we could use
the internet for some research

24
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.720 
Could you speak a little louder?

25
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.220 
The cafeteria was noisy with 90 students

26
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.760 
having lunch
Excuse me?

27
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.300 
Claudia raised her voice over 20
chattering freshmen

28
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.780 
We're going to divide the work
This project is ours to conquer Fernando,

29
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.720 
whose project outline was his to manage,
would research the 1900s

30
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.880 
The statistical data was mine to analyze
While the presentation is yours to design

31
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.020 
She explained to Mike
The final report would be hers to write

32
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.800 
And the coordination was theirs to handle
Referring to our other teammates

33
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.900 
No cap fam, this vibe is Gucci Exclaimed
Mike, trying to sound woke Yes

34
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.640 
The mood is perfect for a study session
Claudia replied Some teachers walked by

35
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.120 
And speak of the devil
It was Karen from the history department

36
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.560 
Known for being the strictest teacher
We decided to jump on the bandwagon of

37
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.000 
using the new study room Which could fit
30 to 40 students I'd like to give this

38
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.760 
my best shot Said Claudia You do your
part yourselves And I'll do mine myself

39
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.060 
at the same time
The room had 10 computers 600 books And

40
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.960 
enough space for 80 people FOMO is real
Texted our friend who couldn't come

41
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.080 
Bet you'll wish you were here
We replied Some students acted like simps

42
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.680 
around Claudia Who was thirsty for knowledge
And had major cloud in academic circles

43
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.860 
Her bae, who visited once a week Brought
us snacks four times a month

44
00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.600 
These resources are a dime a dozen
Fernando complained

45
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.160 
But he was capping
The materials we found

46
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.440 
Were actually quite valuable
We gathered some hundreds And thousands

47
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.620 
of historical data From various sources
We

48
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.120 
worked until someone said I hope not to
sound dramatic

49
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.960 
But we might bite off more than we can chew
I hope so

50
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.100 
Then we'll finish on time
Claudia responded

51
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.400 
The group had played their parts well
And we had come together effectively Past

52
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.580 
projects hadn't gone this smoothly We
were not organized then

53
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.560 
But we are now And we will be even better
next time

54
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.320 
To add insult to injury
The printer broke down After we had

55
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.840 
completed 50 pages
Do we fix it now?

56
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.780 
Did we save everything?

57
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.460 
Will we meet the deadline?

58
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.020 
These questions needed answers Claudia,
being the best student in class While I

59
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.140 
was arguably the worst
Calmly

60
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
handled the situation
The most important thing

61
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.900 
Was that we had known what to do These
technical issues

62
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.280 
Timing is terrible She said By the end of
the day

63
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.240 
We could chill knowing we had done our
best Looking at ourselves

64
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.980 
In the library's reflection We felt proud
The children's projects from last year

65
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.580 
Weren't nearly as good as ours Claudia
commented We earned 100 points on the project

66
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.460 
The highest score possible The teachers'
feedback was glowing

67
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.380 
We had truly created something remarkable
Proving that together We could achieve

68
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.740 
anything end of the day We'll Wiedersehen
I hope that the ë‚˜
