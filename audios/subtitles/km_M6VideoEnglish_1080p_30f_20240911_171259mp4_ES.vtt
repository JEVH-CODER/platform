00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.240 
Escucha esta producción varias veces

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.860 
hasta que la entiendas bien.

4
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.340 
Recuerda que la meta es que puedas

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.960 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.850 
Valeria arrived at the police station

7
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.810 
with a heavy heart.

8
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.390 
She's got to find her brother soon.

9
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.040 
She approached the front desk and said,
Hello! How was your day?

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.260 
I'm here because I was called to check
several bodies to see if any belonged to

11
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.620 
my missing brother, David
.

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.980 
The officer at the desk nodded and leads
her to the room with the bodies that

13
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.800 
arrived today.

14
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
Valeria searches for David's body, trying

15
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.500 
to find any resemblance to David.

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.580 
She had examined several bodies when the

17
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
officer directed her to another room
where the bodies that arrived some time

18
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.880 
ago were kept.

19
00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.800 
Come with me, the bodies are kept in

20
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.980 
another room, he said.

21
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.580 
As they walked towards that room, Valeria

22
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.040 
unexpectedly ran into Daniel, an old
schoolmate who was now a dean.

23
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.020 
Hi there!

24
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.460 
What's up?

25
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.680 
She asked, surprised to see him there.

26
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.680 
Daniel, clearly caught off guard,

27
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.600 
responded evasively.

28
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.640 
Oh, um, I'm here for some, um, some,

29
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.260 
administrative tasks, he said quickly.

30
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.120 
What do you do now?

31
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.640 
Are you still a high school teacher?

32
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.000 
He added, trying to change the subject.

33
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.840 
Valeria looked at him with curiosity.

34
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.400 
Yes, but I need your help.

35
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.220 
I'm here because my brother is missing.

36
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.360 
Do you know something?

37
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.100 
She asked.

38
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.120 
Daniel hesitated before saying, Um, of

39
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.900 
course I don't know.

40
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.240 
Are you still single?

41
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.600 
Yes, but the word still sounds rude.

42
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.340 
Said Valeria.

43
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.980 
Oh, sorry.

44
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.900 
What time is it?

45
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.740 
Daniel asked.

46
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.060 
Twelve o 'clock, why?

47
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
I think I'll go now, said Daniel, and
without waiting for more questions, he

48
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.940 
left the room.

49
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.700 
Valeria entered the second room and

50
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.500 
continued her search.

51
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
The bodies were examined by Valeria

52
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:38.680 
, but unfortunately, she did not find
David's body.

53
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.620 
Disheartened, she exited the morgue and
saw Daniel standing outside, waiting for her.

54
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.000 
I've been waiting for you.

55
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.320 
Daniel said.

56
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.860 
I'd like to invite you out for a coffee
or something.

57
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
Valeria gave Daniel a puzzled look and replied.

58
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.240 
You're strange.

59
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.800 
As Valeria left the morgue, she noticed
that there were several people standing

60
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.960 
in front of the building, waiting for news.

61
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.700 
There are a lot of people here.

62
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.380 
She thought.

63
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.120 
She realized that most of them were also

64
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.640 
waiting for information about their loved ones.

65
00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.180 
Valeria decided not to hang out with

66
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:15.500 
Daniel later.

67
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420 
In the meantime, she needed to make sure

68
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.460 
she got some rest.

69
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.940 
She hoped that tomorrow would be a lucky day.
