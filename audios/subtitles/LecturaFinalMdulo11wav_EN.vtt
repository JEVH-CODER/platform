00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.820 
Dr. Francisco was a dedicated man who
worked hard to become a doctor.

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.060 
He spent years studying medicine,
dreaming of helping others.

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.360 
After his residency, he married the woman
he loved, and they had a son together.

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.840 
Life was good, filled with joy and hope.

5
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.340 
However, everything changed one fateful day.

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.140 
While traveling to another city for a
medical conference, Francisco and his

7
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.240 
family were involved in a tragic accident.

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.040 
The car they were in flipped over after

9
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.180 
hitting a patch of ice.

10
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.700 
Francisco survived, but his wife and son

11
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.200 
did not.

12
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.460 
The loss was devastating, he felt as if

13
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.160 
his heart had been ripped from his chest.

14
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.460 
In shock, Francisco remained at the site

15
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.400 
of the accident, unable to move on.

16
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.520 
Days turned into weeks, and he refused to

17
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.300 
leave the place where he lost his family.

18
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.360 
He became a homeless man, wandering the

19
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.540 
streets but always returning to that spot.

20
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.200 
People passing by would see him sitting

21
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.120 
there, wearing the same clothes he had on
that terrible day.

22
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.100 
As time passed, Francisco's physical
appearance changed, he grew weary and unkempt.

23
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.300 
Yet, in his mind, he was still a doctor,
a healer trapped in grief.

24
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
He often thought about how he could have
saved them if only he had been driving or

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.440 
if they had left home earlier or later.

26
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.040 
One evening, a young woman approached him.

27
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.800 
Why are you here?

28
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.060 
She asked softly.

29
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.900 
Francisco looked up, his eyes filled with pain.

30
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.000 
I lost my family, he said simply.

31
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.620 
The woman sat beside him and listened to
his story.

32
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.100 
She shared her own struggles with loss
and encouraged him to seek help.

33
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.400 
Her kindness sparked something in
Francisco, a flicker of hope.

34
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.800 
Maybe it was time to leave this place
behind and start anew, but the thought

35
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.660 
terrified him.

36
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.800 
Could he really move on without his loved ones?

37
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.500 
After several conversations with the
young woman, who introduced herself as

38
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.880 
Amelia, Francisco began to consider the
possibility of healing.

39
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.740 
He realized that staying in one spot
would not bring his family back, it would

40
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.100 
only keep him trapped in sorrow.

41
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.640 
Finally, one morning, Francisco stood up

42
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.820 
and walked away from the site of the
accident for the first time in years.

43
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.440 
It was a small step toward recovery, but
it felt monumental to him.

44
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.480 
With Amelia's support, he found a shelter
where he could stay and began to rebuild

45
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.080 
his life.

46
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.560 
Though the pain of losing his family

47
00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.180 
would never fully disappear, Francisco
learned that life must continue.

48
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.260 
He dedicated himself to helping others
who faced similar tragedies, using his

49
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.860 
skills as a doctor to provide comfort and care.
