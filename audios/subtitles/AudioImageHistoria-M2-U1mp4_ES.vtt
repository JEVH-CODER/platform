00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.700 
In the Police Station with a Strange Cop

3
00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.940 
Valeria is very desperate.

4
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.640 
She often worries about her brother.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.680 
But now it's different.

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.940 
Her brother is missing.

7
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.420 
She's going to the police station to
report it.

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.920 
Good morning, sir.

9
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.800 
I want to report a missing person.

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
Hello, miss.

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.380 
I'll be asking you some questions to file

12
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.500 
the disappearance report.

13
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.060 
All right.

14
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.500 
Tell me, what's your full name?

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.360 
Valeria Smith.

16
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.500 
Who's the missing person?

17
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.240 
My brother.

18
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.160

20
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.680

He's from Ohio.

24
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.780 
He was born there.

25
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
How old are you?

26
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.120 
I'm 35.

27
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.160 
How old is he?

28
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.940 
He's 28.

29
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.900 
Where do you live?

30
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
I live in Bronx.

31
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.920 
Where does he live?

32
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.120 
He also lives in Bronx.

33
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.920 
He lives with me and my family.

34
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.480 
What do you do?

35
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.860 
I'm a high school teacher.

36
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.560 
I work in St. Louis school.

37
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.120 
And your brother?

38
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.900 
What does he do?

39
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.200 
He's unemployed now, but he was a waiter.

40
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.960 
Where did he work?

41
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.300 
He worked in McDonald's.

42
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.840 
Is he married?

43
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.520 
No, he's not married.

44
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.640 
But he has a girlfriend.

45
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.400 
Does his girlfriend know he's missing?

46
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.500 
I really don't know.

47
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.140 
I haven't talked with her yet.

48
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.580 
Can you please describe your brother?

49
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
Okay.

50
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.520 
He's a good man, though he used to steal
my candies when we were little.

51
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.660 
And he doesn't like to take showers
, but he likes books, photographs, and food.

52
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.880 
Miss, are you kidding me?

53
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.160 
Can you please help me?

54
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.780 
Describe your brother physically.

55
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.640 
Oh, sorry.

56
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
He's tall, short curly hair, brown eyes,
and he's skinny

57
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.800 
.

58
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.540 
What was he wearing the last time you saw him?

59
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.340 
He was wearing a blue shirt, green pants,
and black shoes.

60
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.160 
And why is he missing?

61
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.140 
What do you think?

62
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.020 
I don't know.

63
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.620 
He always tells me where he's going.

64
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.700 
But this time, he didn't.

65
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.020 
Okay, that's it.

66
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.680 
You'll be called if necessary
.

67
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.400 
But do you know anything about him?

68
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.360 
I have got a lot of work to do.

69
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.640 
Next.

70
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.840 
Valeria leaves really worried.

71
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.000 
St. Louis is a very big and dangerous city.

72
00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.460 
Where can he be?

73
00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.940 
She constantly asks herself.
