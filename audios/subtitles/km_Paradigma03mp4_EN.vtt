00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.280 
A couple of business owners were in a
tight spot after their last manager

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.920 
kicked the bucket following an attack.

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.400 
They needed to find a new one, pronto.

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.540 
To make sure they picked the right
person, they sent in the cleaning lady to

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.080 
chat up the candidates on the sly.

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.160 
The candidates had no clue it was all

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.860 
part of the plan.

8
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.600 
The chats seemed like chill encounters,

9
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.560 
focusing on what the candidates got up to
on weekends.

10
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
After she wrapped up her undercover
mission, the cleaning lady gave her scoop

11
00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.040 
to the bosses.

12
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.800 
They strolled into the waiting room and

13
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.940 
dropped the bomb, announcing one of the
candidates as the new manager.
