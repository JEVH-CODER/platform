00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.980 
Valeria's got a small apartment where she
lives with her family.

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.860 
Tonight, they are gathered around the
dinner table for a special meal together.

3
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.840 
The family likes to talk and bother
Valeria, Carrot.

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.700 
Hey Valeria, what do you do now?

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.840 
Asks her Uncle Josh.

6
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.500 
Well, I'm a high school teacher.

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.300 
And I've got some amazing students.

8
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.280 
Valeria answers.

9
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:25.800 
Cool!

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.600 
Do you have a boyfriend already?

11
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.140 
Or are you still single?

12
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.180 
Says her grandpa.

13
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:34.460 
Oh, come on grandpa.

14
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.680 
Can you please stop asking those questions?

15
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.820 
Complaints Valeria.

16
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.240 
To be honest, he can't.

17
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.020 
Dad says.

18
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
I think she's still single.

19
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.400 
No man wants to date a teacher.

20
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.780 
She'll be trying to teach him all the time.

21
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.840 
Says her cousin Mark.

22
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.280 
Hey, what about Daniel?

23
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.340 
He's a good man.

24
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.060 
Says her mom.

25
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.200 
He's cool, but he's not interested in me.

26
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
We are just friends.

27
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.200 
Says Valeria.

28
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.600 
Is he a school teacher too?

29
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.440 
Asks Aunt Mary.

30
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940 
No, he's the school's dean.

31
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.780 
Says Valeria.

32
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.340 
So, do you have a boyfriend?

33
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.220 
Cousin says.

34
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.660 
No, I don't have a boyfriend and I don't
want to have one yet.

35
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.780 
Valeria says.

36
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.640 
And Daniel, does he have a girlfriend?

37
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.440 
Aunt asks.

38
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.940 
No, he doesn't have a girlfriend.

39
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.440 
He has a dog and he treats it like a
human being.

40
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.960 
I really can't tolerate it.

41
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.640 
He even brings his dog to the office.

42
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.340 
I fell the other day when I slipped on
the dog's urine.

43
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.700 
Yuck.

44
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.660 
Don't worry about it.

45
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.720 
Just marry him.

46
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.420 
How old is he?

47
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
Oh my gosh.

48
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.520 
You've got to be kidding me.

49
00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.020 
I'm going to hit the sack.

50
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.880 
I'm tired of all these questions.

51
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.290 
Valeria's trying to sleep when her phone rings.

52
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.990 
Hello?

53
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.010 
Who is it?

54
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.970 
Valeria says.

55
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.630 
No answer.

56
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.350 
Hi, who's there?

57
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.510 
Valeria insists.

58
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.550 
Something dark is happening in your family.

59
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
Slowly says an unfamiliar voice.

60
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.630 
What are you talking about?

61
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.630 
Who do you want to speak to?

62
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630 
Valeria asks, starting to worry.

63
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.550 
Something dark is happening in your family.

64
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.590 
The voice says again.

65
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.670 
I don't understand.

66
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
Why are you telling me that?

67
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.230 
Valeria asks.

68
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.510 
Valeria is in her bedroom trying to

69
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.730 
recover from that horror scene when
someone comes into her room.

70
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.110 
The person is agitated and can barely speak.

71
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.210 
Valeria, your brother's missing.

72
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.470 
What?

73
00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.970 
Wasn't he out in the backyard a few

74
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.530 
minutes ago?

75
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.370 
He was, but now he isn't.

76
00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.250 
Valeria is shocked.
