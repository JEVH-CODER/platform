I'm not.

57
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.780 
The next one.

Say it with me.

65
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.640 
Where is she from?

66
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.980 
Again.

67
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.220 
Where is she from?

68
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.020 
Nice.

69
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.140 
She's from India.

70
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.300 
Pretty good.

71
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.580 
Again.

72
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.400 
She's from India.

73
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.230 
Nice.

74
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.870 
Pretty good.

75
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.150 
Now, the same thing.

76
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.810 
Where is he from?

77
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.390 
Where is he from?

78
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.810 
You?

79
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.170 
Excellent.

80
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.690 
Excellent.

81
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.210 
Nice.

82
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.630 
Again.

83
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.810 
Where is he from?

84
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.220 
Excellent.

85
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.540 
He's Tunisian.

86
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.120 
He's Tunisian.

87
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.640 
So, there's a difference here.

88
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.840 
Hay una diferencia.

89
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.460 
Lo único que está diciendo no es que él

90
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.840 
es de Tunisia o del país, sino que él es tunecino.

91
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.840 
Ok?

92
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.000 
Entonces, está diciendo su nacionalidad.

93
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.040 
Remember, that's another way of answering

94
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.440 
the question
.

95
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.280 
Where are you from?

96
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.760 
Or where is he from?

97
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.240 
Esa también es otra manera de responder a
la pregunta.

98
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.740 
Pretty good.

99
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.100 
Let's go with the next one

100
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.260 
.

101
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.160 
Listen to the video.

102
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.140 
Where is Austria?

103
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.900 
Where is Austria?

104
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.000 
Where is means dónde está?

105
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.220 
Ok?

106
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.680 
Where is Austria?

107
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.740 
Dónde está Austria?

108
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.860 
And we can answer.

109
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.980 
Austria is in Europe.

110
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.540 
Ok?

111
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.580 
Austria is in Europe.

112
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.300 
So, where is Austria?

113
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.320 
Yo respondo.

114
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.000 
Yo pregunto.

115
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.700 
Tú respondes.

116
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.040 
Ok?

117
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.960 
I'll ask and you'll answer.

118
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.180 
Where is Austria?

119
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.320 
Pretty good.

120
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.580 
Excellent.

121
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.820 
Nice.

122
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:34.140 
So, watch the video about Austria in the
next lessons and bye -bye.

123
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.820 
I'm so happy you've been here.

124
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.880 
Remember, tell me in the comments what

125
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.860 
surprised you the most about Austria
. I'm so happy you're getting in Europe

126
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.920 
and we have these things?

127
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.920 
Let me know in the comments.

128
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.960 
It's a little bit.

129
00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.000 
Then we're going to do the math method

130
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.460 
for us with Austria.

131
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.460 
It's like a little bit.
