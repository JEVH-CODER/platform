4
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:45.140 
ello Do you come from a big family?

5
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.040 
My family is rather small

6
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.640 
A long time ago, my family used to live
in the countryside

7
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.080 
And we're still close -knit despite being small
We're small family

8
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.440 
Do you think first impressions matter?

9
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.340 
Well, they do But I think that actions

10
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.440 
over time matter more
What's something you'd recommend to

11
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.180 
someone meeting your family
?

12
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.000 
Well, I would like to know how they feel
about pets, because my family loves animals

13
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.400 
What would you do to make someone feel
comfortable meeting new people?

14
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.260 
What I would do is introduce them to
everyone Help them break the ice

15
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.720 
Do you think family traditions are important?

16
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.160 
I think they can create bonds and

17
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.880 
memories, so yes, they are important
Do you believe everyone in a family has

18
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.020 
to think alike?

19
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.100 
I don't think that everyone needs to

20
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.020 
think alike
But respecting differences is crucial

21
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.780 
What's your idea about family?

22
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.140 
Everyone can be family

23
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.680 
That is to say, family is about support,
not just blood relations How would you

24
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.940 
describe your relationship with your siblings?

25
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.740 
I mean, we argue sometimes, but we've

26
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.540 
always got each other's backs
Do you keep any childhood items?

27
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.480 
I have a box of toys from when I was little
Do you believe in learning from mistakes?

28
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.940 
Absolutely, I've learned from my mistakes
several times

29
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.180 
And that's how I've grown into the person
that I am today Have you ever planned

30
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.860 
something and had it fall through?

31
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.220 
I was going to do a surprise party for my

32
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.340 
dad, but he found out beforehand Where
were you raised?

33
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.700 
I was raised in the suburbs for most of
my life

34
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.880 
Were you always confident growing up?

35
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.340 
I was shy as a child, but I've grown to

36
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.260 
be confident over time
Have you ever been caught off guard by

37
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.600 
someone's expectation?

38
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.120 
I didn't know that my grandparents wanted

39
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.540 
me to take over their business How do you
deal with bad weather?

40
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.800 
Yesterday, I didn't want to go out
because it was raining heavily

41
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.640 
It was raining cats and dogs How do you
make difficult tasks more manageable?

42
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.480 
So that it isn't overwhelming, I break it
into smaller steps

43
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.160 
Do you think you're good at explaining things?

44
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.400 
Well, I don't know, but what I wanted to

45
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.020 
say is that I try to do my best
What's one thing you're curious about

46
00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.900 
right now?

weekends How do you handle misunderstandings?

49
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.680 
Well, just tell me what I can do better

50
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.460 
and we'll work it out What advice would
you give to someone who's hesitant about

51
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.640 
making changes?

52
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.940 
Well, if I were that person, I'd take it

53
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.380 
one step at a time and not overthink it
What's something you'd like to achieve soon

54

?

I want to learn how to cook my family's

56
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.340 
traditional recipes
Why do you think people hesitate about

57
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.980 
trying new things?

58
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.340 
Well, mostly because I don't know how to

59
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.020 
do it
I might feel unsure And I imagine people

60
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.080 
feel the same I imagine others feel the
same What do you focus on when you're busy?

61
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.900 
Concentrating Because when I concentrate,
I get more done in less time

62
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.860 
Why are you pursuing this hobby?

63
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.380 
Because I like to challenge myself to

64
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.800 
improve and grow
How do you politely move through a

65
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.600 
crowded space?

66

Well, I just say Excuse me, please, can I

67
00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.940 
get through?

68
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.360 
Have you tried solving this type of

69
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.540 
issues before?

70
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.720 
Several times And I've learned something

71
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.800 
new each time
Do you visit the same vacation spot often?

72
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.520 
Many times I love how familiar and
relaxing it feels

73
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.660 
Do you ever skip taking a shower?

74
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.060 
Sometimes But I try not to make it a habit

75
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.060 
Do you enjoy childhood activities?

76
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.620 
Once in a while, I like to re -watch

77
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.080 
childhood movies
Do you think everyone values family the

78
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.040 
same way?

79
00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:29.360 
Some people prioritize it more

80
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.000 
And other people focus on other things
Can you name a food you like?

81
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.960 
Yes
For example, I love pasta

82

It's my comfort food
Do you usually agree with your friends' opinions?

83
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.540 
I agree with their thoughts and most things
But not always Do you find it hard to

84
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.660 
express disagreement?

85
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.220 
I don't agree with others just to please them

86
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.800 
I believe in honesty
Do you think it's okay to ask for help?

87
00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.960 
Yes, of course It shows strength, not weakness
Do you listen more than you talk?

88
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.540 
I understand the importance of listening
So I try to do both

89
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.540 
Do you find any topics hard to understand?

90
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.340 
I don't understand complicated math problems

91
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.160 
It's not my strong sweep
When you say that you value connection

92
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.600 
What do you mean?

93
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.360 
What do you mean by connection?

94
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.680 
I'd say it's about meaningful
relationships What do you do when faced

95
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.480 
with setbacks?

96
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.680 
It's not comfortable However, I stay

97
00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.920 
focused And find a way to adapt
When did you last visit your hometown?

open communication
Do you easily believe what others tell you?

102
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.700 
I don't believe that everything people
says is true

103
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.840 
I prefer to verify it myself
Do you think you'll succeed in your next goal?

104
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.340 
I believe that with hard work and
persistence I absolutely will succeed

105
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.160 
Okay, last but not least What do you want
me to do?
