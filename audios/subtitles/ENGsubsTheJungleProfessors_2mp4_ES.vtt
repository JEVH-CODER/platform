1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:08.180 
the jungle professors by day professor
lucas and dr maria were beloved

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:13.320 
university teachers lucas taught zoology
and maria specialized in anthropology

3
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.180 
they were respected by students and
colleagues alike for their vast knowledge

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.240 
yet once night fell their lives changed
entirely the couple lived deep in the

5
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.020 
jungle in a hidden cabin surrounded by
towering trees and wild animals lucas

6
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.480 
asked maria how often do you think
someone will notice our double life maria

7
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.840 
smiled once in a blue moon maybe who
would ever think that two university

8
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.620 
professors could live such a savage life
out here every once in a while they'd

9
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.120 
walk through the dense forest talking
about their day at the university but as

10
00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:01.610 
soon as the sun set they became hunters
they'd go deep into the jungle searching

11
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.050 
for animals to kill and make clothing
from it wasn't just any clothing though

12
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.410 
these weren't your typical professors
their outfits were made from the finest animal

13
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.410 
hides
fur

14
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.070 
and feathers these look snatched
lucas would say after crafting a new outfit

15
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.570 
the jungle had its own rules and they
followed them

16
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.510 
their clothing was a flex showing
off

17
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.690 
their jungle skills one night as they
hunted a wild jaguar lucas pulled maria

18
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:51.980 
aside look out
it's coming toward us he said the jaguar

19
00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:01.850 
lunge but with swift movements lucas took
it down maria panted that was lit we got

20
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.830 
ourselves a new outfit
but their secret wasn't easy to keep what

21
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.690 
happens if someone from the university
finds out

22
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.430 
maria wondered aloud that would be like
letting the cat out of the bag lucas said

23
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:25.770 
but don't worry we'll ghost anyone who
gets too close right maria added plus who

24
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.630 
would believe us when pigs fly someone
might think we're out here hunting

25
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.870 
animals by night despite
their savage night lives

26
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.410 
the couple maintained their university
facade their students would never know

27
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.090 
that their professors dressed in fine
tailored suits during the day spent

28
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.210 
the night weaving jaguar skins into
clothing themselves

29
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.720 
but every once in a while maria would
notice a student's suspicious glance brah

30
00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.260 
do they know she'd ask lucas stop being
so shook he'd reply they're barking up

31
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.060 
the wrong tree if they think we're
anything but boring professors one day

32
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
maria overheard a student asking a
colleague excuse

33
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.880 
me have you thought about what professors
lucas and maria do after class

34
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:23.940 
the colleague laughed sorry i didn't
catch that are you serious maria's heart

35
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:32.720 
raced but she kept her cool sorry she
said and then thought to herself maybe

36
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.980 
they're just pulling someone's leg when
someone asked how old they were lucas

37
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.440 
would laugh old enough to know better but
young enough to still slay at night they

38
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.060 
lived a double life flawlessly they hit
the books by day and hit the jungle by

39
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.340 
night killing two birds with one stone
maintaining both their careers and their

40
00:03:54.350 --> 00:04:01.300 
wild passions
but the jungle was dangerous one night

41
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.960 
lucas almost bit off more than he could
chew when they faced a ferocious pack of

42
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:30.950 
wolves maria
saved the day by using her knowledge of

43
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:41.920 
the jungle to out quit them that was
close she said

44
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.300 
maybe we should call it a day before one
of us ends up kicking the bucket yeah

45
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.660 
lucas agreed but hey we'll still be back
tomorrow

46
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:57.560 
this life is too bustin to stop as they
sat in front of their cabin maria

47
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.980 
turned to lucas is it okay if we take a
break tomorrow i could use a little rest

48
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.120 
sure go
ahead lucas replied

49
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.500 
we've earned it
break a leg out there tomorrow

50
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:16.720 
have you thought about how
we can make this easier maria suggested

51
00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.100 
maybe we should ask for help from our
colleagues good idea

52
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:28.580 
lucas said but i hate to think what they
would say if they knew and so the couple

53
00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.940 
continued their wild dual existence
they lived for the thrill of the hunt and

54
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.280 
loved the challenge of balancing their
jungle lives with their academic careers

55
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.420 
every once in a while they'd spill the
tea on their adventures to a close friend

56
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.080 
but only enough to keep the truth hidden
after all in front of the classroom they

57
00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:53.620 
were just regular teachers but in the
jungle they were something entirely different
