00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.320 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.680 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.860 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.180 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.440 
We'll also learn about contractions.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.840 
Let's get started.

7
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.920 
Elision.

8
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.800 
Sometimes sounds are dropped when we
speak quickly.

9
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.700 
Examples.

10
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.940 
Ok.

11
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.600 
Aquí inicia tu ejercicio.

12
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.400 
Ahora que ya estás bien familiarizado con

13
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.400 
las frases y las palabras claves, solo
vas a escuchar la frase y la vas a repetir.

14
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.360 
I'm gonna go to the doctors tomorrow.

15
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:34.360 
He should have gone to the store.

16
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.320 
I would have gone if I had known.

17
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.100 
You could have told me earlier.

18
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.320 
She must have missed the train.

19
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.900 
We might have been late.

20
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.600 
Give me a call when you arrive.

21
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.560 
Let me know if you need anything.

22
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.120 
Wanna go to the movies?

23
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.020 
I gotta finish this today.

24
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.180 
It's kind of funny how that happened.

25
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.900 
I ran out of milk.

26
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.380 
I need a cup of tea.

27
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.900 
That's a lot of work.

28
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.460 
Whatcha doing this weekend?

29
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.180 
I don't know what to do.

30
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.280 
Assimilation.

31
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.480 
When two sounds are next to each other,

32
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.320 
one may change to sound more like the other.

33
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.340 
Examples.

34
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.620 
Ok.

35
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.280

36
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.060

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.600 
Have to pick up the groceries.

38
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.040 
Wanna eat out tonight?

39
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.740 
Could you help me with this?

40
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.160 
Would you come with me?

41
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.600 
Did y 'all see that movie?

42
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.480 
This shop has great deals.

43
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.340 
That boy is very tall.

44
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.020 
In Paris right now.

45
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.760 
In Paris right now.

46
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.840 
La Sierra was amazing.

47
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.580 
Goo girl did well.

48
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.380 
Green bag is on the table.

49
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.100 
Tongue cards are missing.

50
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:32.140 
Linking.

51
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.560 
Sounds from one word can connect with the

52
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.120 
next word.

53
00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.000 
Examples.

54
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.360

See it now.

61
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.880 
Get up and get moving.

62
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.480 
Turn off the lights.

63
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.800 
Put it over there.

64
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.220 
Bring it to the meeting.

65
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.740 
Call up your friend.

66
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.360 
Find out what happened.

67
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:56.740 
Get out of the car.

68
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.380 
Hold on for a second.

70
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.300 
Reduction.

71
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.040 
Some sounds become weaker or change to

72
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.100 
the schwa vowel, which sounds like, uh, examples.

73
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.300 
Ok.

74
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.960

Can you come here?

80
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.760

81
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.480 
What do you think about this?

82
00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.080 
I'm going to the store.

83
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.600 
He's always late.

84
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.520 
She's coming over later.

85
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.940 
They're not here yet.

86
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
We're going on vacation.

87
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:32.700 
You're the best.

88
00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.040 
It's going to rain.

89
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:35.880 
There's a problem with the car.

90
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
Where's the nearest station?

91
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.020 
Who's coming to the party?

92
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.380 
Contractions.

93
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.760 
Contractions occur when we combine two

94
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.340 
words to make a shorter form.

95
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.260 
Examples.

96
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.560

I'm going to the store.

100
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.660 
You're invited to the party.

101
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.240 
He's already finished.

102
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.000 
She's leaving soon.

103
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.740 
It's a beautiful day.

104
00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.440 
We're having a great time.

105
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.800 
They're going to be late.

106
00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.080 
I'll see you later.

107
00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:03.440 
You'll do great.

108
00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.100 
He'll join us later.

109
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.720

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.980 
It'll be fun.

111
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.280 
We'll meet at noon.

112
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.740 
They'll arrive tomorrow.

113
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.660 
I've finished my homework.

114
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.320 
You've got to see this.

115
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.140 
He's finished his work.

116
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.700 
She's already left.

117
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.600 
It's worked well for years.

118
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.100 
We've been waiting.

119
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:22.520 
They've got the tickets.

120
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.000 
I'd love to go.

121
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.480 
You'd better hurry.

122
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.960 
He'd like some coffee.

123
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.820 
She'd appreciate your help.

124
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.480 
It'd be nice to meet her.

125
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:31.980 
We'd be happy to help.

126
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.960 
They'd prefer a different time.

127
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.600 
I'd finished by then.

128
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.240 
You'd already seen that show.

129
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.300 
He'd been waiting for hours.

130
00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.940 
She'd gone home early.

131
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.560 
It had been a long day.

132
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.440 
We'd seen that movie before.

133
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.900 
They'd already left.
