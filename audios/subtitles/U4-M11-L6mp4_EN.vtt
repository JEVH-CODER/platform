00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.560 
Alright, today we're going to start
learning this word.

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.540 
Phone.

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.300 
Repeat after me.

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:09.880 
Phone.

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.040 
That's right.

6
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.260 
A phone is like un celular.

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.440 
Una pertenencia personal.

8
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.080 
Now we have a phrase over here and it's
can I use your phone?

9
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.840 
Can I use your phone?

10
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.780 
Can I use your phone?

11
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.700 
Dilo conmigo.

12
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.040 
Can I use your phone?

13
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.690 
Excellent.

14
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.970 
Now we have another phrase with phone.

15
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.870 
Tenemos otra frase.

16
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.270 
And it's can you pass me my phone?

17
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.490 
Say it with me.

18
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
Can you pass me my phone?

19
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.760 
Pretty good.

20
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.480 
Can you pass me my phone?

21
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.940 
Significa puedes pasarme mi celular?

22
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.920 
Now we're going to check another thing

23
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.800 
over here and it's a bag.

24
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.160 
Bag.

25
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.700 
Un bag es como un bolso.

26
00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.700 
So we have an interesting phrase with bag

27
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.240 
and it's do you have my bag?

28
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.560 
Dilo conmigo.

29
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.480 
Do you have my bag?

30
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.980 
Tienes my bag?

31
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.660 
Mi bolso?

32
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.380 
Now we could also say another phrase like this.

33
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.540 
She, he or it has.

34
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.240 
Ok, mira, para el resto de las personas,

35
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.440 
para ellos, nosotros, el resto de los
pronombres, pero no te enredes pensando

36
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.980 
en pronombres.

37
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.960 
Pronombres simplemente son formas de

38
00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.440 
referirse a las personas sin mencionar su nombre.

39
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.740 
Como él, ella, eso, nosotros, tú, usted.

40
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.600 
Esos son pronombres, ok?

41
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.280 
No te enredes con la terminología.

42
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.220 
Solo recuerda que para él, ella y objetos
u animales que se representan en inglés

43
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.440 
con it, decimos has.

44
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.180 
No decimos she have, sino she has.

45
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.540 
Por ejemplo, aquí.

46
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.420 
She has a new phone.

47
00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.780 
Excellent.

48
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.820 
Once more.

49
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.880 
She has a new phone.

50
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.860 
That's right.

51
00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.500 
Excelente.

52
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.360 
So now I have good news for you.

53
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.440 
Today we've learned more than 18 words
and more than four English expressions.

54
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.960 
We've also practiced some pronunciation,
listening, and of course, some cultural takeaway.

55
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.660 
Don't forget, don't forget to practice in
Anki, in the platform, and watch resources.

56
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.820 
And also, rate the video and write a
comment down there of at least 15 words.

57
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.800 
Remember that every step forward is a victory.

58
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.600 
Cada paso hacia adelante es una victoria.

59
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.240 
See you in the next one.
