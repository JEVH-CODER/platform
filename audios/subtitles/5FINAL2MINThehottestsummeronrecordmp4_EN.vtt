00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080 
In Climate Watch, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration has

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.900 
released its State of the Climate report
for August.

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.540 
The data shows that this summer was more
than two degrees above normal, making it

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
one of the warmest ever on record.

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.880 
The report also found the amount of

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
climate disasters that occurred in the
United States this summer was abnormal.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.440 
For more, I want to bring in CBS News
Meteorologist and Climate Specialist,

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.240 
Jeff Berardelli.

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.840 
Jeff, the report says this summer is tied

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.880 
with a Dust Bowl summer of 1936.

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.280 
How significant is that?

12
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.760 
Very significant.

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.400 
That was an extraordinarily hot summer

14
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.480 
and it was man -made.

15
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.600 
The reason why it was so hot was caused

16
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
by humans.

17
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.400 
Farmers had gotten rid of all the native

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.180 
grass because a lot of the farmers that
were moving into that area during that

19
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.540 
time didn't have a lot of experience farming.

20
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.640 
So they wiped out all the native grass

21
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.300 
and just left dirt behind.

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.060 
And that dirt would absorb a lot of the

23
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.300 
sun's rays and really, really heat it up.

24
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.060 
And also, it created tremendous dust

25
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.840 
storms, which in many cases were deadly
dust storms.

26
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.940 
So let's talk about what happened this
summer and we'll talk about 1936 as well.

27
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
So for June, July and August, it was the
hottest on record across the West and one

28
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.260 
of the hottest on record in the Upper
Midwest and in the Northeast.

29
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.540 
And it beat out the summer of 1936 by a
sliver, so it's the hottest summer on record.

30
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.920 
You can see temperatures were about 5
degrees above normal across the West.

31
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.740 
But
slightly below normal here near the Gulf Coast.

32
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.940 
That's because it was very rainy and this
is what climate change does, right?

33
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.720 
It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

34
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.180 
And what I mean by that is, where places

35
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.600 
that typically see a lot of rain, they
got more rain.

36
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.000 
Places like Mississippi and Alabama was
the wettest on record for them.

37
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.480 
And that wet air and all that rainfall
extended to the Great Lakes and

38
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.480 
Northeast, where we already have a
surplus of rain typically.

39
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.020 
But across the plains states and most
parts of the West, it was generally a

40
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.480 
fairly dry summer.

41
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.620 
The exception to that was an exceptional

42
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.580 
monsoon in Arizona, where it rained a lot actually.
