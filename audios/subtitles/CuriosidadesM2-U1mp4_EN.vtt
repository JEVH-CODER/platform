00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Deer hunting is an old and interesting tradition in the USA.

3
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
For many, it's a way of life.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Some say it's expensive, but others enjoy the thrill.

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I go hunting every fall, it's fun, but the weather can be tricky, so you have to be ready.

6
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Hunters must get a license, and the number of deer they can hunt is limited.

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Many love the challenge, while others do it for the meat.

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a mix of countable benefits and uncountable rewards.

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Ever feel like you're out of your league?

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Sometimes, but it's exciting.

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Deer hunting can feel out of character for beginners, but with time, it becomes second nature.

12
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Hunters practice often to improve.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
My wife thinks I'm out of my mind spending so much time hunting.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Same here.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I love it.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It's a sport that requires patience and focus.

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Things can go out of your hands, and every moment counts.

18
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In the end, deer hunting is more than a sport.

19
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's about tradition, nature, and connection.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Whether you're seasoned or new, it's an experience that keeps bringing people back.

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
In the United States, it is estimated that around 6 to 7 million deer are harvested each year,

22
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
primarily in states like Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
On average, a harvested deer yields approximately 50 to 70 pounds, 23 to 32 kilograms, of consumable

24
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
meat, depending on the size and species, such as white-tailed deer, mule deer, etc.

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This means the total amount of meat harvested annually ranges from 300 million to 420 million

26
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
pounds, 136 million to 190 million kilograms.

27
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That's a significant amount of meat.
