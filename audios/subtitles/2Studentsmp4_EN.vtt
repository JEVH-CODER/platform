1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.500 
A modern day adventure, the school project.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.660 
Could I ask you something?

3
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.220 
Claudia said to her study group.

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.320 
Has anyone finished the history project yet?

5
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.080 
As four of us sat there in silence, she
knew she had to get her act together.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760 
Every other day for the past week, we had
talked about it, but no one had gotten started.

7
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.440 
Well, I told myself, it's time to spill
the beans.

8
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.200 
I haven't even gone to the library.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.580 
Claudia, being the most organized among

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.000 
ourselves, suggested we help each other.

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
As we brainstormed, I listened carefully

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.500 
to everyone's ideas.

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.620 
Those who work together get better grades.

14
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.420 
She explained.

15
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.460 
The project would cost an arm and a leg

16
00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.900 
in effort.

17
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.280 
We needed to visit five different museums

18
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.360 
seven times each.

19
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.540 
Then, inspiration came when we thought of

20
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
using our smartphones for research.

21
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.000 
How far do you think we'll need to walk?

22
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.820 
Asked Fernando.

23
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.000 
Beside the main museum, there are eight

24
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.520 
others we could check out.

25
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.860 
After visiting eight museums, we realized

26
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.120 
we had only one more left to explore.

27
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.680 
We had known this would be challenging,

28
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
but to make a long story short, we needed
to stop procrastinating.

29
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.560 
We had played around with different
ideas, but couldn't decide.

30
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.480 
Okay, so here's the plan.

31
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.340 
Claudia announced.

32
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.540 
Right now, there's an elephant in the room.

33
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.500 
None of us has taken any action yet.

34
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.240 
She was correct.

35
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.520 
We had seen the deadline approaching, but

36
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.360 
hadn't done anything.

37
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.680 
I'm not sure I follow.

38
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.980 
Said Mike.

39
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.720 
I wanted to tell them that we could use

40
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.140 
the internet for some research.

41
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.180 
Could you speak a little louder?

42
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.780 
The cafeteria was noisy with 90 students
having lunch.

43
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.840 
Excuse me?

44
00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:19.740 
Excuse me?

45
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.840 
Coordination was theirs to handle,
referring to our other teammates.

46
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.980 
No cap fam, this vibe is Gucci.

47
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.620 
Exclaimed Mike, trying to sound woke.

48
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.240 
Yes.

49
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.440 
The mood is perfect for a study session.

50
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.360 
Claudia replied.

51
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.740 
Some teachers walked by, and speak of the

52
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.000 
devil, it was Karen from the history
department, known for being the strictest teacher.

53
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.080 
We decided to jump on the bandwagon of
using the new study room, which could fit

54
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.320 
30 to 40 students.

55
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.020 
I'd like to give this my best shot.

56
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.600 
Said Claudia.

57
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.540 
You do your part yourselves, and I'll do

58
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.140 
mine myself at the same time.

59
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.220 
The room had 10 computers, 600 books, and

60
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.700 
enough space for 80 people.

61
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.680 
FOMO is real.

62
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.180 
Texted our friend who couldn't come.

63
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.640 
Bet you'll wish you were here.

64
00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.200 
We replied.

65
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.100 
Some students acted like simps around

66
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.580 
Claudia, who was thirsty for knowledge
and had major clout in academic circles.

67
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.840 
Her bae, who visited once a week, brought
us snacks four times a month.

68
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.700 
These resources are a dime a dozen.

69
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.000 
Fernando complained, but he was capping.

70
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.640 
The materials we found were actually
quite valuable.

71
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.560 
We gathered some hundreds and thousands
of historical data from various sources.

72
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.500 
We worked until someone said, I hope not
to sound dramatic, but we might bite off

73
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.400 
more than we can chew.

74
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.560 
I hope so, then we'll finish on time.

75
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.480 
Claudia responded.

76
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.140 
The group had played their parts well,

77
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.020 
and we had come together effectively.

78
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.020 
Past projects hadn't gone this smoothly.

79
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.880 
We were not organized then, but we are
now, and we will be even better next time.

80
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.260 
To add insult to injury, the printer
broke down after we had completed 50 pages.

81
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
Do we fix it now?

82
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.280 
Did we save everything?

83
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.360 
Will we meet the deadline?

84
00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.040 
These questions needed answers.

85
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.060 
Claudia, being the best student in class,
while I was arguably the worst, calmly

86
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.160 
handled the situation.

87
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.920 
The most important thing was that we had

88
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.760 
known what to do.

89
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.160 
These technical issues.

90
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.920 
Timing is terrible.

91
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:35.520 
She said.

92
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.560 
By the end of the day, we could chill
knowing we had done our best.

93
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.960 
Looking at ourselves in the library's
reflection, we felt proud.

94
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.880 
The children's projects from last year
weren't nearly as good as ours.

95
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.680 
Claudia commented.

96
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.920 
We earned 100 points on the project, the

97
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.060 
highest score possible.

98
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.780 
The teacher's feedback was glowing.

99
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.540 
We had truly created something
remarkable, proving that together, we

100
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.380 
could achieve anything.

101
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.460 
We'll see you next time.
