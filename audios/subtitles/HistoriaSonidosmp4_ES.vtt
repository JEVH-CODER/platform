In the busy city, a young man decided to
run towards the beach, hoping to escape

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.940 
the noise of the bustling streets.

3
00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.080 
He took a sip of his coffee and noticed a

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.580 
black hat sitting on a bench.

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.500 
As he walked past a store, he heard a

6
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.180 
soft buzz coming from a neon sign, and
the teacher inside smiled as she

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.720 
explained something to her students.

8
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.360 
He thought to himself, Now is the perfect time.

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.560 
The sun shone brightly, and he felt a
sense of peace as he crossed the wooden bridge.

10
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.440 
In the distance, a group of children were
singing, and their laughter filled the air

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.580 
.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
He couldn't help but smile, knowing that

life could still offer simple joys.

14
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.200 
As he reached the end of the road, he

15
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.260 
stopped by a small cafe and ordered a
blueberry smoothie.

16
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.680 
While he waited, he overheard a couple
discussing their next vacation.

17
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.380 
They mentioned wanting to tour pure
natural landscapes, perhaps near the

18
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.400 
mountains, where they could relax and
enjoy the sound of the wind in the trees.

19
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.340 
He noticed a beige house nearby, with a
beautiful garden that seemed to measure

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.400 
the passage of time.

21
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.640 
As he walked, he spotted a sign that said

22
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.740 
Think Fresh, which made him ponder about
the choices he could make.

23
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.180

to face whatever came next.
