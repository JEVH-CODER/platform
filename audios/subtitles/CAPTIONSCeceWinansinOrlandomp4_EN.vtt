00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.960 
We're here in Orlando with the legendary
CeCe Winans.

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.600 
Hi.

3
00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.080 
This is a dream for me to be able to

4
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.760 
speak with you.

5
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.720 
So thank you.

6
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.640 
I mean, really, it's because you are one
of the most respected and just so such a

7
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.880 
broad career.

8
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.400 
And I want to know if like, is there

9
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.060 
anything you can chalk that up to?

10
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.120 
Can you point to why you've been doing

11
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.100 
this for so long and so many stages?

12
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.940 
Hey, you know, it's the goodness of God.

13
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.140 
You know, that's my short answer.

14
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.060 
That is the answer.

15
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.760 
But it's it's it's my relationship with
God that continues to reveal more things

16
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
about who he is.

17
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.840 
So it never gets old.

18
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.160 
The gospel is always relevant.

19
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
So no matter how long you do it, it's

20
00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
effective for every generation.

21
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
And that's that's why I'm still here.

22
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.960 
Yeah.

23
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.680 
But I feel like, too, you have this

24
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.960 
unique gift of connecting with people
outside of the Christian bubble.

25
00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.640 
Yeah.

26
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.980 
And so is that important, do you think,

27
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.120 
as Christians for us to have relationship
with people outside of our?

28
00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.800 
Definitely.

29
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.360 
Definitely.

30
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.200 
We're the salt of the earth and we we are
the light.

31
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.800 
And so we need to have people in our
lives who don't know the Lord so that we

32
00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.800 
can win them to the Lord.

33
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.240 
You know, and God has always allowed my

34
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.360 
music, Bibi and I music to it was
something that we never really planned.

35
00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.340 
But it kind of happened doors open where
because a lot of times people will accept

36
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.900 
the gospel of Jesus Christ faster than
what we think.

37
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.380 
And I think as believers, sometimes we
count people out and God has a space in

38
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.240 
everybody's heart.

39
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.680 
And I've learned that over the years.

40
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.600 
You can go to people that you would never
think would relate and God will connect

41
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.020 
with them.

42
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.600 
Well, and speaking of that, so some of

43
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.380 
the relationships you have now, again, in
like the mainstream music world, for

44
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.300 
example, are you finding that right now
people are more receptive to Christianity?

45
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.160 
Because I feel like I've been hearing
that in a couple of different avenues.

46
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.420 
Like right now people are, I don't know
if it's because of the anxiety people are

47
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.980 
feeling, they're looking.

48
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.920 
Yeah, the world, I mean, I think they've

49
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:56.760 
always been open.

50
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.760 
And where the Bible says where sin

51
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.340 
abounds, grace abounds much more.

52
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.240 
You know, people are hungry for truth.

53
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.900 
They're looking for the light.

54
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.300 
Our world is in desperate need of Jesus.

55
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.420 
They're in desperate need to see what the
real love of God looks like.

56
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.460 
And so I think we all as believers, this
is our time to shine.

57
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.660 
You don't have to keep touring because
you've done so much in your life.

58
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.420 
Could you say that again so my managers
will hear you?

59
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.480 
What I want to know, though, is like walk
us through a day in the life of CeCe.

60
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.100 
Because I feel like, again, you're in a
position, you've been doing this for so long.

61
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.120 
What does it look like for you?

62
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.180 
It depends on the day.

63
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.840 
If I'm home, I am home.

64
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.140 
I am my husband's wife.

65
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.240 
I am the grandmom.

66
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.160 
I don't, Nikki, my makeup artist, no, I

67
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
don't want to see no makeup.

68
00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.440 
I am just Sister CeCe, you know.

69
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.720 
On Sunday, I'm at church.

70
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.640 
I lead worship sometimes.

71
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.860 
And that's just, that's the real me.

72
00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.760 
That's who I am.

73
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.780 
Now, if I'm on tour, then that's another
whole story.

74
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.460 
You know, we're getting up.

75
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.720 
We're going to Soundshake.

76
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.400 
You got the crew.

77
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.300 
You got the buses.

78
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.980 
You're seeing the people that your music
have touched down through the years.

79
00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.540 
So it's such a blessing.

80
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.240 
Even though I'm a homebody, when I get

81
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.720 
out there, I just love the presence of
God and I love his people.

82
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.480 
So it's an honor to do what I do.

83
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:16.080 
Do you cook?

84
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.020 
I do.

85
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.420 
I do.

86
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.300 
Every now and then.

87
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.720 
I used to cook a lot when my kids were younger.

88
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.060 
But now my husband and I, we go out most
of the time.

89
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.440 
Yeah.

90
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.120 
You have the luxury.

91
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.360 
Yeah.

92
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.120 
But I can.

93
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.580 
Now, when I get in there, I know what I'm doing.

94
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.120 
I would, yeah.

95
00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:28.340 
I can see that.

96
00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.800 
I can see that.

97
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.200 
Well, again, mom, grandma.

98
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.820 
That's right.

99
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.780 
I know that a huge part of your platform,
too, is just leaving a faith legacy for

100
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.460 
the next generation.

101
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.860 
Yes.

102
00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.400 
I want to know, though, again, sort of
what we've talked about already.

103
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.680 
What about a musical legacy?

104
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.200 
Because you don't have to stop.

105
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.520 
You've got a lot left in you.

106
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.180 
But because you have so much experience

107
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.260 
and wisdom, what is the musical legacy
that you want to leave?

108
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.100 
Musical?

109
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.700 
You know what?

110
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.260 
I don't think I've ever been asked that question.

111
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.080 
Really good.

112
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.040 
I've been asked a lot of questions over
the years.

113
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.780 
A musical legacy.

114
00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.960 
What would that be?

115
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.120 
I don't know.

116
00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.420 
Give me some suggestions.

117
00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.980 
I don't know.

118
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.140 
I mean, again, I think part of it might

119
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.580 
be having other collaborations.

120
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.460 
Having other collaborations?

121
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.360 
Things fresh, like, I don't know.

122
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.840 
I want to throw it to you.

123
00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.140 
You know, for me, it's being able to
touch every generation.

124
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.260 
You know, I get excited when I go to my
concerts and I see grandma.

125
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.840 
I see people in the generation before me.

126
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.200 
Then I see me.

127
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.940 
Then I see the, and then I see the babies.

128
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.740 
And they're all jumping up saying, that's

129
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.140 
my king.

130
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.480 
You know?

131
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.840 
To me, that's a legacy in the music industry.

132
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.000 
Music that has touched generations.

133
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.100 
And then long after I'm gone, it'll
continue to touch lives.

134
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.760 
And bring people to Jesus.

135
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.320 
Because that's always the goal.

136
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.720 
It's not to entertain, but it is to bring
people to come to know our Savior.

137
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.780 
It sounds like your musical legacy is
your faith legacy.

138
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.340 
Yeah.

139
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.940 
It's all kind of in there together, intertwined.

140
00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.340 
It's beautiful.

141
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.920 
Cece Winans, thank you, Cece.

142
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.480 
You got it.
