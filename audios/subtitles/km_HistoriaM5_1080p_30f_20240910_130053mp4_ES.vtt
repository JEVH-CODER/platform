2
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:07.240 
Escucha esta producción varias veces

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.860 
hasta que la entiendas bien.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.320 
Recuerda que la meta es que puedes

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.960 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:21.780 
Good evening.

7
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.020 
We're gonna start with breaking news from
a quiet suburban area where a tragic

8
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.540 
accident has just happened.

9
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.280 
A man, reported to be drunk, was driving

10
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.780 
alone in his car when he crashed into a tree.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.320 
The impact was severe, and the man was

12
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.160 
thrown through the air, falling 500
meters from the crash site.

13
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.460 
He landed under a bridge that also serves
as a main road.

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.870 
When emergency services arrived to
retrieve the body, they were shocked to

15
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.170 
find, right in front of them, not one,
but two bodies at the scene.

16
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.790 
Our reporter Diana went to that tragic
place, and she's there now.

17
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.410 
Please, Diana, tell us more about it.

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:14.130 
That's right.

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.510 
Authorities have confirmed that one of
the bodies is indeed the driver of the car.

20
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.330 
However, the second body, which was found
next to it, was just discovered that this

21
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.370 
second person had been deceased for a
couple of days before being found, and

22
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.890 
their identity remains unknown.

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.890 
Many are wondering, whose body is this?

24
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.510 
There are speculations that this
individual might be someone involved in

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.010 
the criminal activities reported around
this bridge.

26
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.790 
Neighbors have raised concerns that the
bridge has become a hideout for thieves

27
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.250 
and drug addicts, who've caused much harm.

28
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.350 
With everything they did, they made this

29
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.210 
place dangerous, they said.

30
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.730 
They think it's most likely that the

31
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
unidentified body belongs to one of those
criminals, and many people say that it is

32
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.330 
not worth investigating or closing the road.

33
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.490 
However, a few people supported by a

34
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.970 
human rights organization say they'll go
and file a complaint about such an act of

35
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.350 
intolerance and savagery by the neighbors.

36
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.690 
There is a lot of confusion, yet little

37
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.390 
is known.

38
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.770 
You continue on, studio, Carla.

39
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.520 
Sure, in an attempt to understand the
situation better, authorities are

40
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.620 
investigating further.

41
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.120 
They want to determine if there is a

42
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.800 
connection between the two deaths and
what exactly led to this tragic series of events.

43
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.160 
They have stated that it's too early to
draw any conclusions, and they assure the

44
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.940 
public that they will do their job and
make this case clear.

45
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.820 
For now, the investigation continues, and
we will keep you updated with any new developments.

46
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.980 
Back to you.
