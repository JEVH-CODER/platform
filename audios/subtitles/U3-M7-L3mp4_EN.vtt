1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.680 
All right.

2
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.200 
Welcome back to this lesson.

3
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.760 
Now, today we're going to check some clue
questions that someone will always ask or

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.560 
they should always ask when they're
inviting you to eat in their house.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.960 
All right.

6
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.100 
Esas son algunas frases claves que vas a

7
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.380 
utilizar cuando alguien te invita a comer
en su casa.

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.410 
First up, we have do you eat?

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.770 
Do you eat significa que si comes, bueno,

10
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.090 
según yo, todos los seres humanos deben
comer para existir, pero do you eat?

11
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.490 
Si le añades algo al final, puede
preguntar si comes algo en específico.

12
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.490 
Por ejemplo, do you eat fish?

13
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.570 
¿Comes pescado?

14
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.510 
Di conmigo, do you eat fish?

15
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.270 
That's right.

16
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.450 
Once more, una vez más.

17
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.030 
Do you eat fish?

18
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.590 
Excellent.

19
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.950 
So, tú le puedes preguntar a alguien, por

20
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.390 
ejemplo, cuando lo estás invitando, do
you eat fish?

21
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.350 
¿Comes pescado?

22
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.830 
O puedes reemplazar fish, pescado, por

23
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.790 
cualquier otra opción para preguntarle si
esa persona realmente lo come.

24
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.270 
All right.

25
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.570 
Another thing is bread.

26
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.610 
Oh my goodness, check out this bread.

27
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.470 
Bread es delicioso.

28
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.750 
But now, there are some people who maybe
are on diet and they shouldn't be eating bread.

29
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.430 
A veces podemos estar en dieta y alguna
gente puede estar en dieta y no debe

30
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.090 
comer pan.

31
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.190 
Entonces, ahí es donde es siempre polite,

32
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.990 
educado, pedirles, preguntarles.

33
00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
Do you want some bread?

34
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.610 
Do you want some bread?

35
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.930 
¿Quieres algo de pan?

36
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.390 
Perfecto.

37
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.870 
Entonces, tú deberías preguntarle a la persona.

38
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.030 
Do you want bread?

39
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.390 
Dilo conmigo.

40
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
Do you want bread?

41
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.770 
Una vez más.

42
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.830 
Do you want bread?

43
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.810 
Excellent.

44
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.230 
Y, por ejemplo, si te preguntan de tu
familia, por ejemplo, de tu papá o de tu

45
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.570 
mamá o de algún hermano, tú puedes decir,
he or she doesn't.

46
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.530 
He or she doesn't significa él o ella no.

47
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.210 
All right.

48
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.710 
Por ejemplo, tenemos esta frase de aquí.

49
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.950 
Dilo conmigo.

50
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.190 
She doesn't eat meat.

51
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.730 
Pretty good.

52
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.310 
Once more.

53
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.750 
She doesn't eat meat.

54
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.590 
Excellent.

55
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.750 
Ella no come carne.

56
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.290 
La otra que tenemos es, he doesn't like cheese.

57
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.350 
A él no le gusta el queso.

58
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.030 
He doesn't like cheese.

59
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.310 
Dilo conmigo.

60
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.530 
He doesn't like cheese.

61
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.290 
That's great.

62
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.990 
That's great.

63
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.730 
Excelente.

64
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.170 
Entonces, now, let's mirar esto de aquí.

65
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.990 
Now, where are they?

66
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.170 
You see them here?

67
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.670 
He's desperately trying to throw these

68
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.710 
back in.

69
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.710 
And what did you do?

70
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.670 
Take a slice or a spoon?

71
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.250 
A spoon.

72
00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.210 
And this is the bit you want here.

73
00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.570 
The magnets are in there.

74
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:40.050 
Let's go.

75
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.710 
Cheers.

76
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.500 
Oh, fuck.

77
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.320 
It's really.

78
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:52.400 
It's sour.

79
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.300 
The aftase stays for hours.

80
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.900 
It sticks.

81
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.620 
It has a length.

82
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.660 
It goes on for about two days.

83
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.500 
Let's do that now.

84
00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.540 
Oh, shit.

85
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.580 
That's the fly.

86
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.700 
That's the fly that lays the magnets.

87
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.900 
That's the fly.

88
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.920 
Okay.

89
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.160 
I would defend this.

90
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.780 
Do you like it?

91
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.020 
¿Te gusta?

92
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.740 
Do you think a friend of yours would like it?

93
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.880 
¿Crees que a tu hermano, algún amigo tuyo

94
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.280 
le gustaría?

95
00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.940 
Ugh.

96
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.920 
In my case, no.

97
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.640 
En mi caso, no.

98
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.120 
Pero, otra cosa que puedes decir, por
ejemplo, cuando estás en una casa que te

99
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.720 
invitaron, es I need.

100
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
I need, ya lo hemos visto, significa, yo necesito.

101
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.500 
Por ejemplo, I need a drink.

102
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.660 
Necesito una copa, un trago, un sorbo.

103
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:35.040 
All right?

104
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.480 
Di conmigo.

105
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.240 
I need a drink.

106
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.340 
Pretty good.

107
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.800 
Once more.

108
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:39.560 
I need a drink.

109
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.260 
Excelente.

110
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.120 
Eso significa, necesito un sorbo,

111
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.160 
necesito como un poco.

112
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.760 
Now, if you're in the desert like this, y

113
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.920 
estás, por ejemplo, en el desierto como
esto, usualmente vas a decir, I need a drink.

114
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.700 
Necesito tomar algo.

115
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:55.140 
All right?

116
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.060 
Now, ahora una pregunta.

117
00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.220 
Do we need water?

118
00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.520 
Necesitamos agua?

119
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.940 
What would happen if we drain the oceans?

120
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.780 
¿Qué pasaría si nosotros secamos los
océanos? Vamos a ver este video.

121
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.620 
What if we found a way to drain all the
Earth's oceans through some mysterious

122
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.660 
portal at the bottom of the Mariana Trench?

123
00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.660 
How long would it take?

124
00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:20.440 
Years?

125
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.760 
Centuries?

126
00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.120 
Millennia?

127
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.880 
Would there be any life left on Earth

128
00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:26.920 
when the pumping was over?

129
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.560 
What if it happened overnight?

130
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.300 
This is what if.

131
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.040 
And here's what would happen if we

132
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.400 
drained all the world's oceans.

133
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.580 
Ocean water makes up 70 % of the Earth's surface.

134
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.620 
How much liquid is that exactly?

135
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.100 
Well, if you could put all that water

136
00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.580 
into Olympic -sized swimming pools, you'd
need this many of them.

137
00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.540 
Even if we opened a portal about the size
of a basketball court, it would take us

138
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.100 
hundreds of thousands of years to drain
the oceans.

139
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.820 
They hold over a billion cubic kilometers
of water.

140
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:04.680 
But what if we had a pump powerful enough
to drain all the oceans in a minute?

141
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.980 
What would happen then?

142
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.340 
Sure enough, swimmers, sailors, cruise

143
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.440 
passengers, everyone out on the ocean
would feel the effects quickly.

144
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.260 
Within a second, boaters and swimmers in
shallow water would crash onto the bottom.

145
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.560 
They'd get away with a few broken bones.

146
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.000 
Deep -ocean ships wouldn't be so lucky.

147
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.160 
A titanic -sized liner would hit the
bottom in 30 seconds and smash into tiny pieces.

148
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.280 
The same thing would happen to just about
every large ship on the ocean within the

149
00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.840 
first minute.

150
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.880 
What about all the sea creatures?

151
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.800 
You already know the answer.

152
00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.660 
It would literally be raining fish, since

153
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.800 
all the whales, dolphins, and other big
aquatic animals curiously exploring the

154
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.720 
surface would be falling to the ocean floor.

155
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:49.400 
As for those already near the bottom,

156
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.520 
they'd be lucky not to get sucked down
the drain along with the water.

157
00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.780 
But what comes next is where the real
trouble begins.

158
00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.960 
Our oceans have two life -supporting roles.

159
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.800 
First, they regulate global temperatures

160
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.480 
by absorbing energy from the sun.

161
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.920 
They push warm tropical waters north and

162
00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.560 
south and circulate cold waters back to
the equator.

163
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.600 
This way, no place on Earth gets too hot
or way too cold.

164
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.560 
Global climate control.

165
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.780 
Second, oceans feed the water cycle,

166
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.380 
evaporating into the clouds and raining
back to Earth.

167
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:26.160 
The moment the oceans disappeared, the
Earth would turn into a vast desert.

168
00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.960 
Go ahead and throw away your umbrella,
since it's never going to rain again.

169
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.360 
Wait.

170
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.460 
What about all the lakes and rivers?

171
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:34.720 
Can't we get by with those?

172
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.960 
Well, without oceans, the world loses 97

173
00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:39.960 
% of its water.

174
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.300 
The small amount of liquid left would not

175
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.980 
be enough to sustain the water cycle.

176
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:45.920 
The pools of drinkable water would

177
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.220 
evaporate pretty fast.

178
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.300 
In a matter of days, people and most

179
00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.100 
animals would die from dehydration.

180
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.920 
Plants would have a few weeks before they

181
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.320 
started decaying in the dry air.

182
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.020 
Within a few months, forests would begin

183
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.020 
massive die -offs.

184
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.980 
And all this dry, dead vegetation would

185
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.780 
eventually ignite.

186
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.800 
In a matter of years, most of the world's

187
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:08.260 
forests would be burned down.

188
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.320 
As these huge bonfires sparked all across

189
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.140 
the planet, the atmosphere would become
less and less oxygenated.

190
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:19.880 
If there were still humans at this time,
the unbreathable air and scorching

191
00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.540 
temperature would wipe us out for good.

192
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.060 
All in all, the Earth would end up just

193
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.540 
like Venus, cooked.

194
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.220 
So why not take a few days off and enjoy

195
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.980 
a little seaside vacation while you can?

196
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.820 
Isn't it time to explore how your what

197
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.880 
-if scenario would turn out?

202

pronunciation, listening, and cultural takeaway.

204
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:08.080 
Remember, well done, your dedication with

205
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.420 
Chopin Glass has paid off.

206
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.760 
Bien hecho, tu dedicación con Chopin

207
00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:12.980 
Glass ha dado sus frutos.

208
00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:15.780 
Y sigue dando sus frutos cada día, mucho

209
00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.920 
más si practicas en Anki, en la
plataforma, y si ves algún recurso que a

210
00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:20.520 
ti te guste.

211
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.320 
No te olvides, cada paso hacia adelante

212
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.460 
es una victoria y tú vas en el camino correcto.

213
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:26.460 
Nos vemos en la próxima.
