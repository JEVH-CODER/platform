Did you have forks or knives in the old days?

Forks and knives?

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.660 
Oh sure.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.180 
And spoons.

What are we here to talk about?

19
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.040 
Well, I think it might be how old I am.

20
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.340 
How old are you?

No.

27
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.600 
I don't even know anybody else that old.

28
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.140 
Where are you from?

29
00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.100 
Well, originally, I was born in
Philadelphia, way, way over on the East Coast.

30
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.480 
I was born in New York City.

31
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.300 
Oh, you were.

32
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.820 
So you were born in the East too.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.800 
Yeah.
