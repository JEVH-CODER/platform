00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.480 
In a quiet neighborhood, Eduardo's wife
decided to throw a surprise party for

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.360 
Eduardo's mother.

3
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.080 
Meanwhile, Eduardo's son was trying to

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.840 
hide behind Eduardo's house, excited for
the arrival of the guests.

5
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.080 
Mary's book was on the table, but no one
could concentrate on reading because

6
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.160 
John's car arrived with a loud noise.

7
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.880 
Sophia's dog barked with joy at the sight

8
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.780 
of all his friends.

9
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.380 
At the party, Emily's house filled with

10
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.480 
laughter, and David's bike became the
star of the day, as everyone wanted to

11
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:29.120 
take a ride.

12
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.440 
Jessica's phone rang several times with

13
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
messages from friends who wanted to join
the fun, while Anna's cat watched from

14
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.360 
the window, confused by all the commotion.

15
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.700 
In the end, James' son and Charles'

16
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.080 
friend proposed a fun idea, to have a
bike race, which turned out to be the

17
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.720 
most anticipated event of the party.

18
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.300 
And so, everyone enjoyed themselves,

19
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.960 
celebrating the joy of friendship and family.

20
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.420 
What a great day!
