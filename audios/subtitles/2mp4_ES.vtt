A THURSDAY IN THE PARK Fernando, Michael
and Pedro were friends

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.900 
It was a sunny Thursday and they decided
to go to the park

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.160 
There were many fun things to do
These children were playing and laughing

4
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.620 
and they were having a great time
The three friends walked through the park

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.180 
and thought about what to do next
Hey, I think it's getting really hot

6
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.160 
Let's get some ice cream
One said That's a great idea

7
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.760 
The others said They looked at those
colorful ice cream flavors and couldn't

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
decide which one to choose Then, one of
them said Let's get them all They bought

9
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.580 
a few flavors and thanked the vendor
Though it was hot, they were happy They

10
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.100 
knew that days like this were worth a
thousand memories
