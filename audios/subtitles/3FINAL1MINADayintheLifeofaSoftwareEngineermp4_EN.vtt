Hi, my name is Sarah and welcome to a day
in the life of a software engineer.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.200 
Come on in.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.320 
So, I woke up at 5 today.

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.780 
I already got my workout in, I took care
of my fur kids and gave them a little

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.180 
love, but I officially can't start my
workday without a cup of coffee.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.920 
So, I make a cup of coffee.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.400 
A little over a decade.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.980 
My usual schedule is 8 to 4 and it's kind
of nice to be able to take a break here

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.340 
and there to do anything that I need to
around the house or go to a store if I

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.720 
need to.

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.980 
So, the tasks that I perform on a daily

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.300 
basis include updating my code if
somebody requested a change that I make.

13
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.860 
Sometimes, I spend a lot of time replying
to emails if that's necessary.

14
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.960 
I check in on my interns to see if they
need any help with anything.
