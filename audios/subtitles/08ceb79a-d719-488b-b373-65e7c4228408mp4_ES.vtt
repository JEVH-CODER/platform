Chapter 2.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.750 
In the Police Station with a Strange Cop

3
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.970 
Valeria is very desperate.

4
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.690 
She often worries about her brother.

5
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.710 
But now it's different.

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.990 
Her brother is missing.

7
00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.470 
She's going to the police station to
report it.

8
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:25.960 
Good morning, sir.

9
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.840 
I want to report a missing person.

10
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
Hello, miss.

11
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.420 
I'll be asking you some questions to file

12
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.540 
the disappearance report.

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.100 
All right.

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.560 
Tell me, what's your full name?

15
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.420 
Valeria Smith.

16
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.540 
Who's the missing person?

17
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.300 
My brother.

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.200

20
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.720

I'm from Texas.

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.640 
Where is he from?

He's from Ohio.

24
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.820 
He was born there.

25
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.380 
How old are you?

26
00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.180 
I'm 35.

27
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.200 
How old is he?

28
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.040 
He's 28.

29
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.960 
Where do you live?

30
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.080 
I live in Bronx.

31
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.960 
Where does he live?

32
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.160 
He also lives in Bronx.

33
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.960 
He lives with me and my family.

34
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.520 
What do you do?

35
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.900 
I'm a high school teacher.

36
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
I work in St. Louis school.

37
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.160 
And your brother?

38
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.940 
What does he do?

39
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.240 
He's unemployed now, but he was a waiter.

40
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.000 
Where did he work?

41
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.400 
He worked in McDonald's.

42
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.900 
Is he married?

43
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.560 
No, he's not married.

44
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
But he has a girlfriend.

45
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.440 
Does his girlfriend know he's missing?

46
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.540 
I really don't know.

47
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.200 
I haven't talked with her yet.

48
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.620 
Can you please describe your brother?

49
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.060 
Okay.

50
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.560 
He's a good man, though he used to steal
my candies when we were little.

51
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.540 
And he doesn't like to take showers
, but he likes books, photographs, and food.

52
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
Miss, are you kidding me?

53
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
Can you please help me?

54
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.800 
Describe your brother physically.

55
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.680 
Oh, sorry.

56
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.720 
He's tall, short curly hair, brown eyes,
and he's skinny

57
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.860 
.

58
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.580 
What was he wearing the last time you saw him?

59
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.400 
He was wearing a blue shirt, green pants,
and black shoes.

60
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.200 
And why is he missing?

61
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.200 
What do you think?

62
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.060 
I don't know.

63
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.660 
He always tells me where he's going.

64
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.740 
But this time, he didn't.

65
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.080 
Okay, that's it.

66
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.720 
You'll be called if necessary
.

67
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.440 
But do you know anything about him?

68
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.400 
I have got a lot of work to do.

69
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.700 
Next.

70
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.880 
Valeria leaves really worried.

71
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.040 
St. Louis is a very big and dangerous city.

72
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.500 
Where can he be?

73
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.960 
She constantly asks herself.
