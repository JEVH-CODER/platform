Siempre que quieres hablar del pasado,

por ejemplo, que él estuvo en
kindergarten, que él estaba en el jardín

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.080 
de infancia, por ejemplo.

10
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.380

So, cada vez que vayas a hablar de una
sola persona, dices was.

18
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.860 
Si vas a hablar de varias personas, dices where.

She wasn't home.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.390 
Ella no estaba en la casa.

62
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.710 
She wasn't home.

63
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.000

So, si veste, si te viste cuenta, todos
los de atrás eran una sola persona.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.050 
¿Listo?

74
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.990 
O un solo objeto.

75
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
Entonces, siempre usamos was.

76
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.050 
Ahorita vamos a ver un plural de varias personas.

77
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.610

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.320 
We were just three minutes too late.

89
00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.880 
Solo estábamos tres minutos demasiado tarde.

90
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.420 
O sea, que llegaron tres minutos

91
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.820 
demasiado tarde.

92
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.660 
We were just three minutes too late.

93
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.390

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.870 
Nice.

97
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.170 
She was dead.

98
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.330 
She was dead.

99
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.490 
She was dead.

100
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.430 
Estaba muerta.

101
00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.580 
She was dead.

102
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.260 
Again.

103
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.680 
She was dead.

104
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.420 
Really good.

105
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.780 
Excellent.

106
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.840 
Excellent.

107
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.520 
Now, what would you do if you were in
that situation?

108
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.640 
What would you do if you were in that situation?

109
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.760 
¿Qué harías tú si estuvieras en una

110
00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:48.560 
situación como la de la historia?

111
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.100 
So, check out the story.

112
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.320 
Mira la historia.

113
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.420 
I was going to work as usual.

114
00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.160 
My wife, Anna, was pregnant and our son,
Mike, was really excited about his future sister.

115
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.740 
After work, I went to pick Mike up.

116
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.400 
He was at kindergarten when I received a call.

117
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.460 
It was the worst call I've ever received.

118
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.720 
Mr. Robinson, please come as soon as possible.

119
00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.320 
I called home to talk to my wife, Anna.

120
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.460 
She wasn't home when I called, so I

121
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.700 
called her phone.

122
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:19.960 
Some police officers answered and asked

123
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.320 
me to meet them.

124
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.120 
Had Anna committed a crime?

125
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.900 
No.

126
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.140 
I knew my Anna.

127
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.040 
She's an angel.

128
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.120 
When I got there, I saw a lot of people.

129
00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.420 
The police and the ambulance.

130
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.840 
They were all gathered around something.

131
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.020 
My Anna's body.

132
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.540 
She was run over by a drunk man while

133
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.820 
crossing the street.

134
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.820 
It was a really shocking moment.

135
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.100 
Mike was screaming, and I didn't know how
to calm him down.

136
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.420 
The police told me they were called by
the community when the drunk man fled.

137
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.460 
And that my wife took her last breath
three minutes before we arrived.

138
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.200 
We were three minutes late.

139
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.500 
We were just three minutes too late.

140
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.020 
But nothing could bring my wife back.

141
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:59.180 
She was dead.

142
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.280 
The man was caught and sentenced to 30
years in jail.

143
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.160 
Amazingly, the baby survived.

144
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
She's five now.

145
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.460 
Her name is Miracle.

146
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.800 
She was a miracle.

147
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.110 
For today, congratulations.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.990
