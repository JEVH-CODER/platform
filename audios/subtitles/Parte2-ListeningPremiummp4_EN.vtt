00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.960 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.340 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.480 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.780 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.060 
We'll also learn about contractions.

6
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.440 
Let's get started.

7
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.480 
Elision.

8
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.360 
Sometimes sounds are dropped when we
speak quickly.

9
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:19.260 
Examples.

10
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.480 
Aquí inicia tu ejercicio.

11
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.760 
Recuerda que tienes que escuchar la
frase, la palabra clave, pausar el video

12
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.520 
y repetir.

13
00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.100 
¿Listo?

14
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.740 
Y después sigues para que escuches otras
dos veces la palabra clave.

15
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.120 
I'm gonna go to the doctor's tomorrow.

16
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.760 
I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna.

17
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.320 
He shoulda gone to the store.

18
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.160 
He shoulda, he shoulda, he shoulda.

19
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.680 
I woulda gone if I had known.

20
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.940 
I woulda, I woulda, I woulda.

21

22
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.200 
You coulda, you coulda, you coulda.

23
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.080 
She musta missed the train.

24
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.720 
She musta, she musta, she musta.

Give me a call when you arrive.

28
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.740 
Gimme, gimme, gimme, let me know if you

29
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.460

Don't know, don't know, don't know.

47
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.880 
Assimilation.

48
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
When two sounds are next to each other,

49
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.940 
one may change to sound more like the other.

50
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.880 
Examples.

51
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.160

97
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.540 
Reduction.

98
00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.280 
Some sounds become weaker or change to

99
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.340 
the schwa vowel, which sounds like, uh, examples.

100

I'm going to the store.

122
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.460 
I'm, I'm, I'm.

123
00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.700 
He's always late.

124
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.160 
He's, he's, he's.

127
00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.000 
They're not here yet.

128
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.980

Who's, who's, who's.

141
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.280 
Contractions.

142
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.680 
Contractions occur when we combine two

143
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.240 
words to make a shorter form.

144
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:46.140

We'll meet at noon.

They'll arrive tomorrow.

174

They'll, they'll, they'll.

175

You've got to see this.

178
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
You've, you've, you've.

179
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.940 
He's finished his work.

180
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:45.720 
He's, he's, he's.

181
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:46.940 
She's already left.

182
00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.160 
She's, she's, she's.

183
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.960 
It's worked well for years.

184
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.040 
It's, it's, it's.

185
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.140 
We've been waiting.

186
00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.080 
We've, we've, we've.

187
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.160 
They've got the tickets.

188
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.020 
They've, they've, they've.

189
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
I'd love to go.

190
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:01.920 
I'd, I'd, I'd.

191
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:02.760 
You'd better hurry.

192
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.340 
You'd, you'd, you'd.

193
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.420 
He'd like some coffee.

194
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.100 
He'd, he'd, he'd.

195
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.520 
She'd appreciate your help.

196
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.480 
She'd, she'd, she'd.

197
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.980 
It'd be nice to meet her.

198
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.620 
It'd, it'd, it'd, it'd.

199
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.900 
We'd be happy to help.

200
00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.640 
We'd, we'd, we'd.

201
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.380 
They'd prefer a different time.

202
00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.440 
They'd, they'd, they'd.

203
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.820 
I'd finished by then.

204
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.360 
I'd, I'd, I'd.

205
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.640 
You'd have loved the show.

206
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.320 
You'd, you'd, you'd.

207
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.900 
He'd been waiting for hours.

208
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:29.560 
He'd, he'd, he'd.

209
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.840 
She'd gone home early.

210
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.780 
She'd, she'd, she'd.

211
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.020 
It'd been a long day.

212
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.220 
It'd, it'd, it'd, we'd seen that movie before.

213
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:40.060 
We'd, we'd, we'd, they'd already left.

214
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.760 
They'd, they'd, they'd.

215
00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.980 
We'd, we'd, they'd.

216
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.120 
We'd, we'd, we'd, we'd.
