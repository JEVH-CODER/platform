1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.280 
This is Anna.

2
00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.860 
She just graduated from college in the

3
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.660 
United States.

4
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.580 
And this is Sofia.

5
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.920 
She also just graduated from college in Finland.

6
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.440 
Anna and Sofia both want to be middle

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.720 
school teachers, but it turns out,
there's a good chance their experiences

8
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.380 
will be very different.

9
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.180 
So different, that Anna is twice as

10
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.480 
likely as Sofia to leave teaching for good.

11
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.660 
That's causing a problem.

12
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.960 
The supply of new certified teachers in
the United States is shrinking, but the

13
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.960 
number of public school students keeps growing.

14
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.080 
Massive teacher shortages.

15
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.220 
Warnings about teacher turnover.

16
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.100 
Educators call Colorado's teacher

17
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.400 
shortage a crisis.

18
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.480 
So what makes Sofia stay and Anna leave?

19
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.620 
And how can the United States keep more
of its teachers in the classroom?

20
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.960 
In the US, teachers work about 9 1⁄4
hours a day.
