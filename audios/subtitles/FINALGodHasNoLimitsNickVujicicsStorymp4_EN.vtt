00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.840 
Hi, my name is Nick Vujicic, and when I
was born without arms and legs, my

2
00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.440 
parents had no idea that their limbless
boy would turn into the hands and feet of

3
00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.700 
the love of Jesus Christ spread all
around the world.

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.260 
As a child, I was bullied, and I went to
Sunday school and learned that Jesus

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.300 
loved me, that He had a hope plan in the
future for me as well.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.260 
Well, I'm like, What kind of plan is this?

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.700 
Can I suggest a plan B?

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.940 
So, I prayed for arms and legs, and they
did not come, and when I didn't hear

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.780 
anything from heaven, I started doubting
that He indeed had a plan for me.

10
00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.400 
So, I prayed for arms and legs, but what
I realized what I needed more was heaven,

11
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.300 
peace, purpose, and forgiveness of my sins.

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.060 
At age 10, I tried to commit suicide

13
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.380 
because of the bullying predominantly at school.

14
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.960 
I didn't feel like I would ever be

15
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.400 
independent and only a burden to my parents.

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.600 
I would always be alone and never get

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.600 
married and never have a family and never
find a purpose worth living for, hence, a

18
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:01.740 
value worthy.

19
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.220 
So, I tried to commit suicide at age 10

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.920 
with 6 inches of bathwater.

21
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.300 
I was stopped by one thought, and the

22
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.300 
thought was seeing my mom and my dad
crying at my grave, wishing they could

23
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.220 
have done something more.

24
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.500 
At age 15, I gave my life to the Lord

25
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.540 
Jesus Christ because I realized more than
arms and legs, I wanted purpose and

26
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.480 
salvation and healing, forgiveness of my sins.

27
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.720 
I wanted Jesus, but I still didn't know

28
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.600 
why I was born this way.

29
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.340 
Well, in John chapter 9, everyone asked

30
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.940 
Jesus why was that blind man born that way.

31
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.060 
Jesus said it was done so that the works

32
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.460 
of God would be revealed through Him.

33
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.500 
What I realized, I was actually as blind

34
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.440 
as the blind man.

35
00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.480 
We had no idea what God had in store, and

36
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.460 
just because you don't see what God has
in store doesn't mean His store is empty.

37
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.100 
Kids come up and say, What happened?

38
00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.940 
And I say, Cigarettes.

39
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.800 
Definitely as a child and a teenager, I
had never thought I would be a speaker

40
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.420 
that would travel around the world and
meet presidents and speaker congresses

41
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.880 
and be in stadiums as large as 110 ,000.

42
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.680 
I had no idea.

43
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.760 
And I just give God all the glory and all
the praise for the people who pray for

44
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.960 
us, the people who support us, and made
this possible to travel around and preach

45
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.140 
the gospel to millions of souls.

46
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.300 
God loves me not because of what I can do

47
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.200 
or what I will do for the kingdom of God.

48
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.380 
He just loves me for me.

49
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.160 
When I put my little foot on my wife's
womb as she was pregnant with our first

50
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.340 
son, I felt him kick and I looked at my
wife in her eyes and I said, Babe, I love him.

51
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.260 
I never touched him, saw him, heard him
laugh, seen him smile.

52
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.740 
He never earned my love.

53
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.860 
That love was always there from the

54
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.840 
beginning, before he was even born.

55
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.260 
So be challenged today to know that God

56
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.380 
is not done with you yet.

57
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.440 
He wants to stretch you a little bit.

58
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.060 
And I dare you to believe in the
greatness of our God, because He has no limit.
