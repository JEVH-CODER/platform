1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.860 
we wanted to explore what makes a family.

2
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.820 
We brought together seven families for

3
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.000 
the biggest cast of Odd Man Out yet.

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.780 
And we are a family.

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.100 
We are a family.

6
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
We're a family.

7
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.740 
We are a family.

8
00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.280 
We are a family.

9
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.700 
And we're a family.

10
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.980 
And we are a family.

11
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.080 
One is a liar.

12
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.300 
If the group discovers who the liar is,

13
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:24.680 
they'll split a cash prize.

14
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.820 
If the liar remains, they'll win the cash prize.

15
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.860 
This is Odd Man Out.

16
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.810 
And I'm Ryan.

17
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.430 
And we're from Orange County, California.

18
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.490 
Are you guys excited?

19
00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.510 
Uh, yeah.

20
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.230 
Heck yeah.

21
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.690 
To win this thing.

22
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.610 
I'm Iris.

23
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.700 
Iris, I'm Liberty.

24
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.340 
And we are family.

25
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.460 
We live in Anchorage, Alaska.

26
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.980 
So we're gonna rely heavily on our

27
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.520 
intuition, ask a lot of questions.

28
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.940 
Hi, I'm Tamara.

29
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.600 
And we are from London.

30
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.900 
And we are...

31
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.240 
The family.

32
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.500 
Lux.

33
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.700 
It's honestly my favorite YouTube show,
so I'm pretty excited to be part of it.

34
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.520 
And she dragged me into it.

35
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.740 
The truth will come out easy.

36
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.800 
Yeah, if they're nervous around each other.

37
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.720 
My name is Emily.

38
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.500 
My name is Chris.

39
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.680 
And we're twins.

40
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.320 
Fraternal.

41
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.180 
Rat twins.

42
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.340 
Ew.

43
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.220 
Hi, I'm Jacqueline.

44
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:22.080 
I'm Jayda.

45
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.020 
I'm Jordan.

46
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.720 
I'm Raj.

47
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.840 
And I'm Huey.

48
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.900 
We got to analyze everyone.

49
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.460 
Hi, my name is Phu.

50
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.560 
Hi, my name is Lynn.

51
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.800 
So the strategy that we are planning to

52
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.000 
use is to look at people's body language
and kind of like looking for answers that

53
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.380 
are generic and there's no uniqueness in them.

54
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.840 
I think we're gonna catch who the mole is

55
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:43.380 
pretty soon.

56
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:17.840 
One wave.

57
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
Who do you think it is?

58
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.120 
They all look related.

59
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.860 
They all look like they could be family.

60
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.780 
Boy and girl, the blondes, definitely

61
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.480 
they're family.

62
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.340 
I think the group of three in the middle

63
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.480 
is a big family.

64
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
I think so too.

65
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.400 
Something looked off.

66
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.200 
Yeah, but we look related, no?

67
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.940 
True, true, but we might get...

68
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.400 
Well, I hope we look related.

69
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.220 
I like you.

70
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.560 
Shoot.

71
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.300 
Oh, God.

72
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.900 
I mean, if we get kicked out and they're

73
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.860 
just like, There's no way she can be the
mother because she's so young, then I'm

74
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.800 
okay with that.

75
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
I'm gonna do imposter.

76
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.350 
Oh my God, really?

77
00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.790 
Where should we go?

78
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.850 
Yeah, we'll do imposter.

79
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.010 
Okay, so green lemon.

80
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.970 
Because I feel like if they put a lot of
people, it's gonna be hard for us.

81
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.710 
I'm most suspicious of the nomads.

82
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.230 
We'll pick the one with green lemon.

83
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.910 
Green lemon, okay.

84
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.010 
No, just two people now.

85
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.150 
Right, green lemon.

86
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.030 
I think we should vote for the three people.

87
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.870 
I think so too.

88
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.230 
Yeah.

89
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.530 
One, two, three.

90
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.990 
Nomads.

91
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.950 
Simone, nomads, okay.

92
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.050 
Okay, we already have a tie, you guys.

93
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.410 
We're gonna bring together the three
teams to plead their case.

94
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.570 
The first team to plead their case is imposters.

95
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.570 
Hello.

96
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.350 
Hi.

97
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.530 
So we are sister and we're from Texas and

98
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.010 
we're not, you know, we're like blood
related for sure.

99
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.030 
That's so sus.

100
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.350 
Yeah, we just have like different face shape.

101
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.690 
We have pretty similar face shape.

102
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.370 
We're both round, I guess.

103
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.030 
Yeah, that's it.

104
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.130 
I don't know what to say.

105
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.320 
The next group to plead their case is nomads.

106
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.840 
Hi.

107
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.400 
Hi.

108
00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.100 
Hello.

109
00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.680 
So we are siblings, one, two, three, and four.

110
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.560 
And that's my dad and that's my mom.

111
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.300 
And that's my brother.

112
00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.080 
I think what threw people off is the fact

113
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.360 
that my oldest son looks a lot like his mama.

114
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.520 
He went to the door and the rest of them

115
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:29.520 
took after me.

116
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.380 
Yes, we're family.

117
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.180 
Look at me in his face.

118
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.920 
You look the same.

119
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.000 
Yes, we are family.

120
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.380 
This is really a good joke.

121
00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.380 
Mom, don't say yes, we're family.

122
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.680 
Like, mom, you look like your brother and

123
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.860 
I know.

124
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.760 
Last one, green lemon.

125
00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.480 
Hi.

126
00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.960 
So I'm Emily.

127
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.800 
I'm Chris.

128
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.180 
I don't know, pleading our case, we're

129
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.640 
both from La Jolla, California because we
were both born in Scripps Hospital.

130
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.340 
We're both blonde, we're fraternal twins,
so we're not identical.

131
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.820 
He was five minutes older and he holds it
over my whole life, literally.

132
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.440 
The best five minutes of my life.

133
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.100 
I don't know how to prove it, really.

134
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.920 
Our mom's name is Bridget, our dad's name
is Rick.

135
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.780 
We're both sort of similar, but very
different in other ways.

136
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:18.960 
We currently live together.

137
00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.340 
I'm the loud one, yeah.

138
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.840 
We're both going to college in New York.

139
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.080 
I go to NYU.

140
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.960 
I go to Hunter College.

141
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.720 
I love the way he was like, the best five

142
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.640 
minutes of my life.

143
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.320 
Yeah, that was funny.

144
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.700 
That sounds like something a twin would say.
