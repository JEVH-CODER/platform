00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.680 
She was working in her office, a small
platform with one goal, to uncover a

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
secret project.

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.100 
Anna loves her job as a police officer,

4
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.740 
but this case was different.

5
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.140 
Her friend Eduardo's mysterious work has

6
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.380 
been calling her forward.

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.780 
Every day, she would study his moves,

8
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.440 
learn about his working method.

9
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.880 
He was not just a simple man in charge.

10
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.080 
Something was wrong.

11
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.900 
Anna believed her friend was hiding

12
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.780 
something big.

13
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.560 
When she arrived at his house late one

14
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.480 
night, she saw him quickly flee through a
back door.

15
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.140 
The project became a game of cat and mouse.

16
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.340 
She would track him, he would run.

17
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.940 
Anna's dedication to the truth was incredible.

18
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.720 
Finally, she caught him in a shocking moment.

19
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.080 
He was stealing important documents from
a famous company.

20
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.840 
But why?

21
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.620 
His reason was both surprising and heartbreaking.

22
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.100 
He needed money to help his sick daughter.

23
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.740 
Anna understood his pain.

24
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.120 
In the end, she made a difficult decision.

25
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.160 
She would help him, but justice must be served.

26
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.180 
Their friendship would never be the same.

27
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.280 
Her friendship would never be the same.

28
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.680 
Thank you.
