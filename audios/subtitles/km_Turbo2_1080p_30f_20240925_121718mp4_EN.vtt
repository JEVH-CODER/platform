Christopher's Return Chapter 1 An Ordinary day 

5
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.810
Edith, a single mother, looked at her four children
before heading to work.

6
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.000
She knew she had to leave everything in order.

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.350
Christopher, you are responsible for your brothers
and sister today.

8
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.110
She said firmly.
Serve them lunch and don't let anyone leave the house.

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.310
Christopher, the eldest, nodded.
He was always careful, but that day something

10
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.790
unexpected was going to happen.
Edith looked at him again.

11
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.070
Are you going to follow my instructions?
She asked.

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.990
Yes, mom, I will.
Christopher replied, though deep down he loved

13
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.750
the idea of being free for the day, he liked
to play outside with his friends.

14
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.390
Why would he not?
They always had fun.

15
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.630
Chapter 2 Temptation Knocks After Edith left,
the temptation came quickly.

16
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.230
Christophers older friends, all between 15 and
20 years old, arrived at the house.

17
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.870
What are you doing here?
Christopher asked, confused.

18
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.440
We are going to the beach, you should come with
us, one of them said, smiling mischievously.

19
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.080
Christopher hesitated.
He knew his mother had told him to stay, but

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.910
his friends kept pushing.

21
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:39.310
Come on, you like to swim, Another friend added.
Christopher liked to take risks, but was it worth

22
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.750
disobeying his mother?
What do you think you're doing?

23
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:50.470
Samuel, his nine year old brother asked.
Mom told you to stay, she won't find out, Christopher

24
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.790
said.
I just have to go for a little while.

25
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.870
What could go wrong?
Without further thought, he decided to go, asking

26
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.870
his siblings to stay inside and behave.

27
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:08.830
I'll be back soon, he told them.
Chapter 3 Trouble in the water at the beach,

28
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.390
The boys immediately jumped into the water.
When did you last swim like this?

29
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.670
One of the friends asked, teasing.
I love to swim.

30
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.550
Christopher said confidently.
He felt strong as he began crossing the river,

31
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.750
but halfway through, his legs started to cramp.
Suddenly, Christopher felt a sharp pain in his

32
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.990
legs.
He couldn't move them.

33
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.310
He tried to call for help, Help me, I can't swim
anymore.

34
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.200
But his friends laughed.
He's joking, one of them said.

35
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.510
He always plays pranks like this.
But this time he wasn't playing.

36
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.550
As he struggled to keep his head above water,
he realized they weren't coming back for him.

37
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.390
Christopher's heart sank.
How could they leave me here?

38
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.240
The friends reached the shore, exhausted.
Did you see him stop?

39
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.470
One asked.

40
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.150
I thought he was faking, but fear took over them
quickly.

41
00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.390
They didn't go back to help him.
Instead, they panicked and ran home, deciding

42
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.550
not to speak about what had happened.
Chapter 4 The Disappearance Meanwhile, Edith

43
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.630
returned home at 3:00 PM.
She was angry when she found only Samuel, Daniel,

44
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.400
and Sophia at home.
Where is your brother?

45
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.960
She asked.
He went to the beach with his friends.

46
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.230
Samuel replied quietly.

47
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.910
Edith felt a wave of panic.
He isn't supposed to leave the house, she said,

48
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.630
pacing back and forth.
Why did he go?

49
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.400
Worried, she sent Samuel and Daniel to look for
him, but they returned empty handed.

50
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.320
As hours passed, Edith's worry turned to fear.
Where could he be?

51
00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:02.120
By 6:30 PM, Christopher still hadn't come home.
Edith started knocking on the doors of all his friends.

52
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.880
Did you see Christopher today?

53
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.670
She asked his friend's parents, but they all
denied knowing anything.

54
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.990
He wasn't with us today, they said.
But Edith knew they were lying.

55
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:19.910
Finally, a neighbor spoke up.
I saw him leave with a group of boys.

56
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.070
They were heading to the beach.
The neighbors words hit Edith like a punch.

57
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.240
She had to find her son.
Chapter 5 The Desperate search.

58
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.430
At 11:45 PM, Edith and some of the boys parents
went to the beach.

59
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.030
The only thing they found was the sound of the river
rushing by, but no sign of Christopher.

60
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.550
Where could he be?
She asked out loud, her voice trembling.

61
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.870
Days passed and there was still no sign of him.
Edith felt as if she was losing her mind.

62
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:58.310
Why didn't he listen to me?
She asked herself over and over again.

63
00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.560
Did something terrible happen?

64
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.320
Chapter 6 The Unexpected Miracle Three days later,
a miracle occurred.

65
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.590
Edith received news from a group of Indigenous people who
had found a boy lost in the jungle.

66
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.390
He didn't remember anything.
It's your son, one of them said.

67
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.390
Christopher was weak, but alive.
He couldn't explain how he had survived, but

68
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.550
the indigenous people had cared for him, giving
him food and shelter.

69
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.430
They brought him back to her.
When Edith saw him, she hugged him tightly.

70
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.750
He promised her he would never do something like that
again.

71
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:41.470
I am sorry, he said, his eyes full of regret.
I won't leave again without telling you.

72
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.710
Chapter 7 The Lesson Learned From that day on,
Christopher became more responsible.

73
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:53.350
He understood the danger of making reckless decisions and
how much his family cared for him.

74
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.550
His siblings were just happy to have him back.
Now, when Christopher looked out at the beach,

75
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.990
he didn't just see fun and games, he saw a reminder
of the lesson he had learned the hard way.
