00:00:14.575 --> 00:00:17.430 
Welcome to today's debate on whether governments should

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.440 
have the authority to prohibit social media in their
country.

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:28.400 
We have two panelists, Alex, who will argue in
favor of prohibition and Jamie who will argue against it.

7
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.480 
Let's begin with opening statements.

8
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.640 
Thank you.
To start, I would like to highlight that in the

9
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280 
past, several governments have used various means
to control the flow of information.

10
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.920 
For instance, back in the early 2000s, some governments
used to restrict Internet access during times of political

11
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.440 
unrest.
This history suggests that it is not unprecedented for

12
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.440 
governments to exert control over digital platforms.

13
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.040 
Looking to the future, governments might be about
to implement stricter regulations on social media due to

14
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.510 
increasing concerns about misinformation.

15
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:11.470 
And security social media platforms are often seen as
breeding grounds for harmful content, which can

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.390 
lead to significant social unrest.
Governments could therefore have the obligation to

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.470 
intervene to maintain public order.
Thank you, Alex.

18
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.510 
While it's true that some governments have intervened in
the past, it's crucial to consider the implications

19
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.150 
of such actions.
The prohibition of social media would likely lead to

20
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.470 
unintended consequences.

21
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.430 
For example, when governments prohibited social
media in the past, the results were often

22
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.990 
counterproductive.
People found alternative methods to communicate and share

23
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.990 
information, sometimes even making the situation
worse.

24
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.990 
Speculating about the future.
If a government were to ban social media, it

25
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.630 
could face considerable backlash from the public and
international community.

26
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.270 
The necessity to preserve free speech and the right to
access information might outweigh the perceived benefits of

27
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.240 
such a prohibition.

28
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.360 
But we must not ignore the fact that social media can
spread harmful content that can have real world

29
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.120 
consequences.
For instance, social media platforms were used

30
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.880 
to incite violence in various countries.
If governments have the authority to regulate these

31
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.600 
platforms, they would be able to prevent the
spread of dangerous content.

32
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.600 
In this case, governments would have to act despite
the potential backlash.

33
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.720 
While it's important to address harmful content,
banning social media might not be the most effective

34
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.280 
solution.

35
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.000 
Government should instead focus on improving digital
literacy and creating regulations that target the misuse of

36
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.800 
social media without completely prohibiting it.
The right approach would be to balance regulation with the

37
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.040 
preservation of free speech.
Moreover, the argument that prohibiting social

38
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.480 
media would lead to increased underground activity doesn't
necessarily hold water.

39
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.750 
Negative adverbial aside, the primary concern
is the safety and security of the public.

40
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.430 
By controlling what is shared online, governments
could prevent the dissemination of harmful information.

41
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.110 
Nonetheless, considering the present, it is vital
that governments find a way to adapt to the digital age

42
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.910 
without resorting to extreme measures.
The future of social media and its role in society should

43
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.270 
be managed with careful thought.
Rather than sweeping bands, the government's

44
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.920 
role should be about finding balanced solutions that uphold
democratic values while addressing genuine concerns.

45
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.910 
In conclusion, while a complete ban on social
media might be a drastic measure.

46
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.030 
Governments may need to consider it as part of a broader
strategy.

47
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.350 
The need for security might justify such actions in
specific circumstances, even though it is an

48
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.950 
approach that should be used with caution.
In summary, it is crucial to approach the issue

49
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.110 
with a nuanced perspective.
The future of social media regulation should involve a

50
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.230 
combination of strategies rather than an outright ban to
ensure that freedom of expression is preserved while

51
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.810 
addressing legitimate concerns.

52
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.410 
Thank you, Alex and Jamie for your insightful
arguments.

53
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.970 
This concludes our debate on whether the government can or
should prohibit social media in their country.

54
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.986 
Take care and I'll see you in the next one.
