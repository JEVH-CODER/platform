2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.280 
Escucha esta producción varias veces

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.340 
hasta que la entiendas bien.

4
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.340 
Recuerda que la meta es que puedas

5
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.260 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.660 
Valeria arrived home exhausted and worried.

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.759 
As she walked into the living room, she
found her parents sitting on the couch,

8
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.639 
engrossed in a political debate on TV.

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.380 
Hi.

10
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.799 
Valeria said, her voice tight with frustration.

11
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.819 
What are you doing?

12
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.940 
David is missing.

13
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.420 
Her parents barely looked up from the screen.

14
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.780 
Oh, hello, Valeria.

15
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.780 
We're just discussing the latest news.

16
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.480 
Her mother replied.

17
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.880 
You should join us.

18
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.780 
What do you think about the new policies?

19
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.020 
Valeria's anger flared.

20
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.140 
How can you sit here and watch TV when
your son is out there somewhere missing?

21
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.880 
This is outrageous.

22
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.820 
Her father sighed and said.

23
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.540 
You should calm yourself.

24
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.600 
That's not our problem.

25
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.140 
Valeria couldn't believe her ears.

26
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.039 
Why do you say this isn't our problem?

27
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.580 
Because it's not our business.

28
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.000 
Her mother said matter of factly.

29
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.479 
What do you mean?

30
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.020 
Valeria demanded.

31
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.360 
My relative, my brother and your son.

32
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.520 
No, he's not, her father said.

33
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.320 
You see, when we got married, we wanted
children but couldn't have one.

34
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.520 
One day, the pastor called us.

35
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.360 
Come over to my house, please, he said.

36
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.679 
When we arrived, he showed us a baby.

37
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.679 
We found him in the church basement.

38
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.179 
Someone must have abandoned him there,
yet we mustn't do the same.

39
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.580 
And I know you want children and he can't
take care of himself, the pastor said.

40
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.140 
So we took him in.

41
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.960 
After all, he was right.

42
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.759 
We wanted a baby and he couldn't take
care of himself.

43
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.180 
Valeria's face turned pale.

44
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.480 
And so?

45
00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.060 
He's your adopted son, but he's still
your son.

46
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.540 
He's still part of our family.

47
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.360 
We have to help him.

48
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.680 
No, we don't have to, her father said firmly.

49
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.380 
We never officialized the adoption and

50
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.600 
he's already of age.

51
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.960 
Valeria left the house feeling indignant.

52
00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.460 
She walked quickly to the church to speak
with the pastor.

53
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.360 
She really didn't used to go to church on
Mondays, but this was an emergency.

54
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.520 
She found the pastor praying in one of
the benches.

55
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.520 
I'd like to talk with you, Valeria said urgently.

56
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.160 
Oh, Valeria, what a surprise.

57
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.520 
Are you getting used to praying and
attending church on Mondays too?

58
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.460 
The pastor asked, looking up.

59
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.880 
I would like to talk with you, Valeria repeated.

60
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.300 
My parents don't want to help my brother
and they might change their minds if you talk to them.

61
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.720 
Well, they might or might not change their minds.

62
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.800 
Tell me what happened.

63
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.920 
Anguished, Valeria talked about the
situation with the pastor.

64
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.220 
So, I think they should help anyway.

65
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.080 
They shouldn't turn their backs on him now.

66
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.500 
What do you think about it?

67
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.700 
The pastor listened carefully and said,

68
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:36.020 
Well, let me tell you a story.
