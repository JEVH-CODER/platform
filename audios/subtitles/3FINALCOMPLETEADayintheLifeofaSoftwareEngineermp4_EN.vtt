00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.360 
Hi, my name is Sarah and welcome to a day
in the life of a software engineer.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.200 
Come on in.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.320 
So, I woke up at 5 today.

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.780 
I already got my workout in, I took care
of my fur kids and gave them a little

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.180 
love, but I officially can't start my
workday without a cup of coffee.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.920 
So, I make a cup of coffee.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.400 
A little over a decade.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.980 
My usual schedule is 8 to 4 and it's kind
of nice to be able to take a break here

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.340 
and there to do anything that I need to
around the house or go to a store if I

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.720 
need to.

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.980 
So, the tasks that I perform on a daily

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.300 
basis include updating my code if
somebody requested a change that I make.

13
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.860 
Sometimes, I spend a lot of time replying
to emails if that's necessary.

14
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.180 
I check in on my interns to see if they
need any help with anything.

15
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.060 
My desk setup consists of two external monitors.

16
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.820 
One is for code, one is for seeing my

17
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.460 
changes, and then my computer for emails
and different terminal things.

18
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.720 
I also just have a little fun space where
my birthday cards sit and then a whole

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.880 
slew of different mice and keyboards.

20
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.580 
So, the first thing that I'm going to do

21
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.580 
today coding wise is making sure that
what I built works.

22
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
This can usually take between 30 minutes
to an hour depending on what I'm working on.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.140 
So, right now, my primary languages
include Java and a lot of HTML and CSS,

24
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.960 
but I find the most fun in writing
anything based out of JavaScript.

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.240 
So, like Node .js.

26
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.080 
So, I personally use Sublime.

27
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.640 
I think it's very low effort and is
really easy to use.

28
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.360 
It's really difficult to write code the
first time and it be right.

29
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.120 
So, either you're going to find a mistake
or somebody is going to say, Hey, this

30
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.440 
isn't really working the way that you
said it would and you're just going to

31
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.500 
have to be okay with that.

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.400 
The first thing I coded today was the

33
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.960 
Delete button.

34
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.400 
And so, you can see the code here.

35
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.720 
And this page is represented on this page
as the UI or the front end.

36
00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.700 
And you can see that each what I call
card has a Delete button.

37
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.240 
And so, now, if you click on Delete,
it'll delete that specific card.

38
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.140 
And now, there are no collections.

39
00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.140 
One of the benefits of working from home

40
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.940 
as a software engineer is being able to
cook at home.

41
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.720 
It's my form of meditation to kind of
reposition my brain.

42
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.900 
I get to think about what I'm going to
work on next.

43
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.040 
I get to process maybe a meeting that I
was just in, but cooking is really a way

44
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.080 
for me to recenter myself for the day.

45
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.960 
I like to spend time on Reddit and I

46
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.640 
think a lot of us do when we're on the
computer pretty much all day.

47
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.680 
But, I also catch up on YouTube videos or
maybe just talk to my friends on Discord,

48
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.400 
maybe plan what I'm going to do for the evening.

49
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.000 
But, that usually is about 30 to 45 minutes.

50
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.920 
Right after lunch, I get to get into work.

51
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.180 
And, since most of my meetings occur in

52
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.080 
the morning, I really get a longer time
period in the afternoon to have my next

53
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.780 
coding session.

54
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.860 
So, I can range between one to two hours

55
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.440 
instead of having to kind of take breaks.

56
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.040 
I feel the most creative in the afternoon.

57
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.600 
I think that's because I've had all of my
coffee and I've had my food or my snacks.

58
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.680 
And, I really just am into the meat of
the day.

59
00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
So, in the afternoons, I have more energy
in my brain to accomplish the tasks that

60
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.820 
I set for myself.

61
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.580 
I like to keep up with new software and

62
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.260 
new frameworks that happen and come up by
actually looking through job openings.

63
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.460 
And, if there is a new framework that's
really important, a lot of companies will

64
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.580 
post that in their job description or a requirement.

65
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.600 
So, I'll kind of go through what jobs are

66
00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.240 
available and see what companies are
using most of.

67
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.700 
And, sometimes, I even learn about new
frameworks that way.

68
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.180 
Another great thing about working from
home is being able to leave if I have to.

69
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
And, I'm feeling something really spicy tonight.

70
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.800 
So, there is a store that I'm going to go

71
00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.260 
to and do a little grocery shopping.

72
00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.790 
In order to become a better software

73
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.590 
engineer, I would recommend maybe going
to a class website like Udemy or a coding bootcamp.

74
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.490 
Or, even just kind of thinking about a
project that you like to build and

75
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
starting it from scratch.

76
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.670 
Gaining experience by doing is the best

77
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.950 
way to keep yourself up to date and
become a better software engineer.

78
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.150 
I got into my profession kind of by accident.

79
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.690 
I knew that I wanted to write.

80
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.730 
So, I actually started off as a
journalism major.

81
00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.710 
But, I wanted to kind of work with my
creative side.

82
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.610 
So, I decided to write code, which I am
writing, but I'm also using my creative side.

83
00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.710 
So, I went from being a journalism major
to a software engineer.

84
00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.470 
My goals for my future are to kind of
transition into more of a management role.

85
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.830 
So, I enrolled myself into a project
management course.

86
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.410 
What's nice about being in this field is
that continued education is very

87
00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.250 
important to a lot of people.

88
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.570 
So, you get time to be able to do that.

89
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.750 
I usually wrap up my day by going through
my emails and making sure that I didn't

90
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.930 
miss anything that I was supposed to get
to by today.

91
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.050 
I check my work schedule for tomorrow to
see if there are any meetings.

92
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.750 
Last thing I like to do at the end of the
day, or I have to do at the end of the

93
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.330 
day, is log my time.

94
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.630 
So, I worked on the front end for about

95
00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:42.830 
four hours today, and I worked on other
things for about another four hours.

96
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.830 
So, that's eight hours.

97
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.670 
And, I try to end my day around four so

98
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.450 
that I have enough time at the end of the
day to kind of wind down from it.

99
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.610 
Software engineering can be pretty
stressful, so the best way for me to wind

100
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.550 
down from a stressful workday is to play
video games.

101
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.950 
It's just a really easy and relaxing game
to wind down my day.

102
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:10.250 
I think coding asks a lot from you, and
it takes a lot of energy to do it, so I

103
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.470 
would recommend just being okay with a
high -stress, high -energy environment.

104
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.830 
And, make sure to speak your mind and
just be yourself, and it's going to be okay.
