1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.680 
All right.

2
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.180 
Welcome back to this lesson.

3
00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.760 
Now today we're going to check some clue
questions that someone will always ask or

4
00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.560 
they should always ask when they're
inviting you to eat in their house.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.960 
All right.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.080 
Esas son algunas frases claves que vas a

7
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.380 
utilizar cuando alguien te invita a comer
en su casa.

8
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
First up we have do you eat?

9
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.770 
Do you eat significa que si comes, bueno,

10
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.470 
según yo todos los seres humanos deben
comer para existir, pero do you eat, si

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.490 
le añades algo al final puede preguntar
si comes algo en específico.

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.490 
Por ejemplo, do you eat fish?

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.570 
Comes pescado?

14
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.590 
Dí conmigo, do you eat fish
? That's right.

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.910 
Once more, una vez más.

16
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.590 
Do you eat fish?

17
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.390 
Excellent.

18
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.110 
So, tú le puedes preguntar a alguien, por

19
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.750 
ejemplo, cuando lo estás invitando, do
you eat fish?

20
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:55.930 
Comes pescado?

21
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.190 
O puedes reemplazar fish, pescado, por

22
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.110 
cualquier otra opción para preguntarle si
esa persona realmente lo come.

23
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.210 
All right.

24
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
Another thing is bread.

25
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.590 
Oh my goodness, check out this bread.

26
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.270 
Bread es delicioso.

27
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.150 
But now, there are some people who maybe
are on diet and they shouldn't be eating bread.

28
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.730 
A veces podemos estar en dieta y alguna
gente puede estar en dieta y no debe

29
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.850 
comer pan.

30
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.230 
Entonces, ahí es donde es siempre polite,

31
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.890 
educado, pedirles, preguntarles.

32
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.190 
Do you want some bread?

33
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.090 
Do you want some bread?

34
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.330 
¿Quieres algo de pan?

35
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.370 
Dilo conmigo.

36
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.690 
Perfecto.

37
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.310 
Entonces, tú deberías preguntarle a la persona.

38
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.030 
Do you want bread?

39
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.790 
Dilo conmigo.

40
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.290 
Do you want bread?

41
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.050 
Una vez más.

42
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.790 
Do you want bread?

43
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.550 
Excellent.

44
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.010 
Y, por ejemplo, si te preguntan de tu

45
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.130 
familia, por ejemplo, de tu papá o de tu
mamá o de algún hermano, tú puedes decir,

46
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.390 
he or she doesn't.

47
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.950 
He or she doesn't.

48
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.050 
Significa él o ella no.

49
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.030 
All right.

50
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.610 
Por ejemplo, tenemos esta frase de aquí.

51
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.210 
Dilo conmigo.

52
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.470 
She doesn't eat meat.

53
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.030 
Pretty good.

54
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.590 
Once more.

55
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.590 
She doesn't eat meat.

56
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.930 
Excellent.

57
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.190 
Ella no come carne.

58
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.390 
La otra que tenemos es, he doesn't like cheese.

59
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.870 
A él no le gusta el queso.

60
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.930 
He doesn't like cheese.

61
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.030 
Dilo conmigo.

62
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.030 
He doesn't like cheese.

63
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.770 
That's great.

64
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.710 
That's great.

65
00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:28.150 
Excelente.

66
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.030 
Entonces, now, let's mirar esto de aquí.

67
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.670 
Now, where are they?

68
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.650 
You see them here?

69
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:35.370 
He's desperately trying to burn them back in.

70
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.830 
And what did you do?

71
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.050 
Take a slice or a spoon?

72
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.430 
A spoon.

73
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.950 
And this is the bit you want here.

74
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.950 
The maggots are in there.

75
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:40.710 
Let's go.

76
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.100 
Cheers.

77
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.340 
Oh, fuck.

78
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.100 
It's brilliant.

79
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.860 
It's sour.

80
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.660 
The aftase stays for hours.

81
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.120 
It sticks.

82
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.800 
It has a length.

83
00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.740 
It goes on for about two days.

84
00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.180 
Oh, stop that now.

85
00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.360 
Oh, shit.

86
00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.880 
That's the fly.

87
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.840 
That's the fly that lays the maggots.

88
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:02.920 
That's the fly.

89
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.480 
Okay.

90
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.200 
I would defend this as...

91
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.700 
Do you like it?

92
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.200 
¿Te gusta?

93
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.760 
Do you think a friend of yours would like it?

94
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.960 
¿Crees que a tu hermano, algún amigo tuyo
le gustaría?

95
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.540 
Ugh.

96
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.220 
Más que esa no.

97
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.880 
En mi caso no.

98
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.700 
Pero otra cosa que puedes decir, por

99
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.520 
ejemplo, cuando estás en una casa que te
invitaron, es I need.

100
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.560 
I need, ya lo hemos visto, significa yo necesito.

101
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.140 
Por ejemplo, I need a drink.

102
00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.860 
Necesito una copa, un trago, un sorbo.

103
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.200 
All right?

104
00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.140 
Di conmigo, I need a drink.

105
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.580 
Pretty good.

106
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.000 
Once more.

107
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.260 
I need a drink.

108
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.520 
Excelente.

109
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.660 
Eso significa, necesito un sorbo,

110
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:45.580 
necesito como un poco.

111
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.960 
Now, if you're in the desert like this, y

112
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.920 
estás, por ejemplo, en el desierto como
esto, usualmente vas a decir, I need a

113
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.980 
drink. Necesito tomar algo.

114
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.860 
All right?

115
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.520 
Now, ahora una pregunta.

116
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.220 
Do we need water?

117
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.080 
Necesitamos agua?

118
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.560 
What would happen if we drain the oceans?

119
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.140 
¿Qué pasaría si nosotros secamos los océanos?

120
00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.220 
Vamos a ver este video.

121
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.040 
What if we found a way to drain all the
Earth's oceans through some mysterious

122
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.880 
portal at the bottom of the Mariana Trench?

123
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.440 
How long would it take?

124
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.760 
Years?

125
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.100 
Centuries?

126
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.380 
Millennia?

127
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.140 
Would there be any life left on Earth

128
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.900 
when the pumping was over?

129
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.520 
Or, what if it happened overnight?

130
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.820 
This is what if.

131
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.320 
And here's what would happen if we

132
00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.060 
drained all the world's oceans.

133
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.280 
Ocean water makes up 70 % of the Earth's surface.

134
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.860 
How much liquid is that exactly?

135
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.320 
Well, if you could put all that water

136
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.800 
into Olympic -sized swimming pools, you'd
need this many of them.

137
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.880 
Even if we opened a portal about the size
of a basketball court, it would take us

138
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.120 
hundreds of thousands of years to drain
the oceans.

139
00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.960 
They hold over a billion cubic kilometers
of water.

140
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.320 
But, what if we had a pump powerful
enough to drain all the oceans in a minute?

141
00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.020 
What would happen then?

142
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.880 
Sure enough, swimmers, sailors, cruise

143
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.460 
passengers, everyone out on the ocean
would feel the effects quickly.

144
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.140 
Within a second, boaters and swimmers in
shallow water would crash onto the bottom.

145
00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.380 
They'd get away with a few broken bones.

146
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.800 
Deep -ocean ships wouldn't be so lucky.

147
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.940 
A titanic -sized liner would hit the
bottom in 30 seconds and smash into tiny pieces.

148
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.500 
The same thing would happen to just about
every large ship on the ocean within the

149
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:34.920 
first minute.

150
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.900 
What about all the sea creatures?

151
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.360 
You already know the answer.

152
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.780 
It would literally be raining fish, since

153
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.120 
all the whales, dolphins, and other big
aquatic animals curiously exploring the

154
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.320 
surface would be falling to the ocean floor
.

155
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.640 
As for those already near the bottom,
they'd be lucky not to get sucked down

156
00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.680 
the drain along with the water.

157
00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.760 
But what comes next is where the real

158
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
trouble begins.

159
00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.600 
Our oceans have two life -supporting roles.

160
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.340 
First, they regulate global temperatures
by absorbing energy from the sun.

161
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.560 
They push warm tropical waters north and
south and circulate cold waters back to

162
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.780 
the equator.

163
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.020 
This way, no place on Earth gets too hot

164
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.140 
or way too cold.

165
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.780 
Global climate control.

166
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.140 
Second, oceans feed the water cycle,
evaporating into the clouds and raining

167
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:25.060 
back to Earth
. The moment the oceans disappeared, the

168
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.740 
Earth would turn into a vast desert
.

169
00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.720 
Go ahead and throw away your umbrella,
since it's never going to rain again.

170
00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:34.360 
Wait, what about all the lakes and rivers?

171
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.740 
Can't we get by with those?

172
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.180 
Well, without oceans, the world loses 97
% of its water.

173
00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.420 
The small amount of liquid left would not
be enough to sustain the water cycle.

174
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.700 
The pools of drinkable water
would evaporate pretty fast.

175
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.960 
In a matter of days, people and most
animals would die from dehydration.

176
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:57.820 
Plants would have a few weeks before they
started decaying in the dry air.

177
00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:01.620 
Within a few months, forests would begin
massive die -offs.

178
00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.600 
And all this dry, dead vegetation would
eventually ignite.

179
00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:10.320 
In a matter of years, most of the world's
forests would be burned down.

180
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.520 
As these huge bonfires sparked all across
the planet,

181
00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.900 
the atmosphere would become less and less oxygenated.

182
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.380 
If there were still humans at this time,

183
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.120 
the unbreathable air and scorching temperature
would wipe us out for good

184
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:23.340 
.

185
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.780 
All in all, the Earth would end up just

186
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:27.180 
like Venus, cooked.

187
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.620 
So why not take a few days off and enjoy

188
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:33.140 
a little seaside vacation while you can?

189
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:34.900 
Isn't it time to explore how your what

190
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.060 
-if scenario would turn out?

191
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.340 
Write a comment, at least 15 words down below.

192
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:54.580 
Escribe un comentario de mínimo 15
palabras ahí abajo.

193
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.080 
Y ahora te voy a dar una noticia súper buena.

194
00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.540 
El día de hoy hemos aprendido más de 19

195
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.780 
palabras and more than five English expressions.

196
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.960 
We'll also practice pronunciation,

197
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:07.780 
listening and cultural takeaway.

198
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.420 
Remember, well done, your dedication with

199
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.480 
Chopin Inglés has paid off.

200
00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.000 
Bien hecho, tu dedicación con Chopin

201
00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:16.960 
Inglés ha dado sus frutos y sigue dando
sus frutos cada día.

202
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.360 
Mucho más si practicas en Anki, en la
plataforma y si ves algún recurso que a

203
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.840 
ti te guste.

204
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:24.380 
No te olvides, cada paso hacia adelante

205
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.460 
es una victoria y tú vas en el camino correcto.

206
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:26.960 
¡Nos vemos en la próxima!
