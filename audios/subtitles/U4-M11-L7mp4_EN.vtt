1
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.560 
All right.

2
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.640 
Si una persona

3
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.240 
So, now, let's practice phrase number one.

4
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.580 
Vamos a ver la número uno.

5
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.100 
Eso significa, ¿cuántos años tendrá esa persona?

6
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.060 
¿Cuántos años crees que tiene esa persona?

7
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.000 
Dilo conmigo.

8
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.160 
How old do you think that person is?

9
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.380 
Pretty good.

10
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.640 
Once more.

11
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
How old do you think that person is?

12
00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.250 
Excellent.

13
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.650 
Now, this guy is heading towards a cliff.

14
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.930 
Este señor está yendo como hacia un barranco.

15
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.830 
Let's see how it ends.

16
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.570 
Oh my goodness, in a bike?

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.730 
I don't know about you, but I want to do that.

18
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.210 
Now, heading towards significa ir hacia.

19
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.830 
Okay?

20
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.950 
So, you could say that person is heading

21
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.330 
towards 40.

22
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.290 
Esa persona está, va para los 40.

23
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.870 
All right?

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.030 
O ya está llegando a los 40.

25
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.970 
Heading towards, va hacia los 40.

26
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.390 
Now, we have here a lot.

27
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.610 
Wow.

28
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.990 
If there's money in those bags, do you

29
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.050 
think it's too little or it's a lot?

30
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
Si hay dinero en esas bolsas, ¿cree que

31
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.610 
sería bastante o poco?

32
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.090 
Well, it's a lot.

33
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.830 
Si hay en cada una de esas dinero, then
it's a lot of money.

34
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.550 
Entonces, es un montón de dinero.

35
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.250 
Obviamente depende de la moneda, ¿no?

36
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.110 
Pero si digamos que son dólares, it would
be a lot of money.

37
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.690 
Now, over here we got, if they're 20,
that's a lot.

38
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
Si tienen 20 años, eso es mucho.

39
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.670 
Dilo conmigo.

40
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.770 
If they're 20, that's a lot.

41
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.100 
Pretty good, pretty good.

42
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.860 
Now, we got another phrase over here, and
it's, they're around 30.

43
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.860 
Tienen como 30.

44
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.720 
Dilo conmigo.

45
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.340 
They're around 30.

46
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.020 
Excellent.

47
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.700 
Once more.

48
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.240 
They're around 30.

49
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.140 
Excelente.

50
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.580 
Eso es como para decir que ellos están

51
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.080 
más o menos llegando a 30, se pasan, le
falta un poquito, pero van por ahí va la cosa.

52
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.680 
All right?

53
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.280 
Around 30.

54
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.920 
Por ahí, por 30.

55
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.740 
Now, let's check out these people, and I

56
00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.780 
want you to tell me how old do you think
they are.

57
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.160 
Vamos a mirar y diga, ¿cuán viejo crees
que son?

58
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.580 
I woke up one morning, little Hennessy,
and my old Kaplan, I am...

59
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.400 
All right, all right, well, they're a hundred.

60
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.940 
Todos esos tienen 100 años.

61
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.800 
They're a hundred.

62
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.300 
But now, let's check over here.

63
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.320 
This is very important.

64
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.720 
Tiene esto muy presente.

65
00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.540 
Don't ask an older lady her age.

66
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.280 
No le preguntes la edad a una señora mayor.

67
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.680 
Especially in English, you should never,
okay, you should never do that.

68
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.620 
So, di conmigo, don't ask an older lady
her age.

69
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.220 
Now, the whole phrase, don't ask an older
lady her age.

70
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.910 
Pretty good.

71
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.970 
Now, a little faster.

72
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.810 
Don't ask an older lady her age.

73
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.650 
Pretty good.

74
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.110 
Excellent.

75
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.410 
Now, today, we've learned more than 25

76
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.390 
words and more than five English expressions.

77
00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.070 
We've also practiced some pronunciation,

78
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:42.610 
listening, and cultural takeaway.

79
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.270 
Now, don't forget to rate the video.

80
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.410 
Dale estrellitas al video.

81
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.370 
And also, down there, in the comments

82
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.090 
below, write a comment of at least 15 words.

83
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.310 
Have this in mind.

84
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.730 
Every step forward is a victory.

85
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.310 
You're going on the right way.

86
00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.590 
So, keep going on.

87
00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:58.830 
Keep going forward.

88
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.210 
You're heading towards success.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.490
