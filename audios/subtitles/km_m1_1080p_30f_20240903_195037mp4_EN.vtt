00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.080
Valeria has got a small apartment where
she lives with her family.

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
Tonight, they are gathered around the
dinner table for a special meal together.

3
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.900
The family likes to talk and bother
Valeria, Carrot.

4
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.920
Hey Valeria, what do you do now? asks her
uncle Josh.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.440
Well, I'm a high school teacher and I've
got some amazing students.

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.460
Valeria answers.

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.860
Cool, do you have a boyfriend already or are you still single? says her grandpa.

8
00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.740
Oh, come on grandpa, can you please stop

9
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.760
asking those questions?

10
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.880
complains Valeria.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.480
To be honest, he can't.

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.180
Dad says.

13
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.740
I think she is still single, no man wants
to date a teacher, she will be trying to

14
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.880
teach him all the time.

15
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.060
says her cousin Mark.

16
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.420
Hey, what about Daniel, he is a good man.

17
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.180
says her mom.

18
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.460
He is cool, but he is not interested in
me, we are just friends.

19
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.300
says Valeria.

20
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.720
Is he a school teacher too?

21
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.560
asks Aunt Mary.

22
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.020
No, he is the school dean.

23
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.840
says Valeria.

24
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.400
So, do you have a boyfriend?

25
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:23.380
cousin says.

26
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.740
No, I don't have a boyfriend and I don't

27
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.820
want to have one yet.

28
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.880
Valeria says.

29
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.680
And Daniel, does he have a girlfriend?

30
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.500
Aunt asks.

31
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.200
No, he doesn't have a girlfriend, he has
a dog and he treats it like a human

32
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.780
being, I really can't tolerate it, he
even brings his dog to the office.

33
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.380
I fell the other day when I slipped on
the dog's urine.

34
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.760
Yuck!

35
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.820
Don't worry about it, just marry him.

36
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.520
How old is he?

37
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.640
Oh my gosh, you've got to be kidding me,

38
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.080
I'm going to hit the sack, I'm tired of
all these questions.

39
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.350
Valeria is trying to sleep when her phone rings.

40
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.120
Hello, who is it?

41
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.040
Valeria says.

42
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.820
No answer.

43
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.440
Hi, who is there?

44
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.640
Valeria insists.

45
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.600
Something dark is happening in your family.

46
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.520
Slowly says an unfamiliar voice.

47
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.760
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.740
Who do you want to speak to?

49
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.720
Valeria asks, starting to worry.

50
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.620
Something dark is happening in your family.

51
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.740
The voice says again.

52
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.800
I don't understand, why are you telling

53
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:42.520
me that?

54
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.300
Valeria asks.

55
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.440
Valeria is in her bedroom trying to
recover from that horror scene when

56
00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:52.780
someone comes into her room.

57
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.280
The person is agitated and can barely speak.

58
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.280
Valeria, your brother is missing.

59
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.580
What?

60
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.660
Wasn't he out in the backyard a few
minutes ago?

61
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.380
He was but now he isn't.

62
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.300
Valeria is shocked.
