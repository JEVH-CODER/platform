00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.360 
Hi, my name is Sarah and welcome to a day
in the life of a software engineer.

2
00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.200 
Come on in.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.320 
So, I woke up at 5 today.

4
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.780 
I already got my workout in, I took care
of my fur kids and gave them a little

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.180 
love, but I officially can't start my
workday without a cup of coffee.

6
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.920 
So, I make a cup of coffee.

7
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.400 
A little over a decade.

8
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.980 
My usual schedule is 8 to 4 and it's kind
of nice to be able to take a break here

9
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.340 
and there to do anything that I need to
around the house or go to a store if I

10
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.720 
need to.

11
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.980 
So, the tasks that I perform on a daily

12
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:50.300 
basis include updating my code if
somebody requested a change that I make.

13
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.860 
Sometimes, I spend a lot of time replying
to emails if that's necessary.

14
00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.180 
I check in on my interns to see if they
need any help with anything.

15
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.060 
My desk setup consists of two external monitors.

16
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.820 
One is for code, one is for seeing my

17
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.460 
changes, and then my computer for emails
and different terminal things.

18
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.720 
I also just have a little fun space where
my birthday cards sit and then a whole

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.880 
slew of different mice and keyboards.

20
00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.580 
So, the first thing that I'm going to do

21
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.580 
today coding wise is making sure that
what I built works.

22
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
This can usually take between 30 minutes
to an hour depending on what I'm working on.

23
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.140 
So, right now, my primary languages
include Java and a lot of HTML and CSS,

24
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.960 
but I find the most fun in writing
anything based out of JavaScript.

25
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.240 
So, like Node .js.

26
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.080 
So, I personally use Sublime.

27
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.640 
I think it's very low effort and is
really easy to use.

28
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.360 
It's really difficult to write code the
first time and it be right.

29
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.120 
So, either you're going to find a mistake
or somebody is going to say, Hey, this

30
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.440 
isn't really working the way that you
said it would and you're just going to

31
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.500 
have to be okay with that.

32
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.400 
The first thing I coded today was the

33
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.960 
Delete button.

34
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.400 
And so, you can see the code here.

35
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.700 
And this page is represented on this page
as the UI or the front end.

36
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.700 
And you can see that each what I call
card has a Delete button.

37
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.400 
And so, now, if you click on Delete, it
will delete that specific card and now,

38
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.120 
there are no collections.
