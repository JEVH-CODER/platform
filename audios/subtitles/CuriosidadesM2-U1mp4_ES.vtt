00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.250 
Deer hunting can feel out of character

3
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.370 
for beginners, but with time, it becomes
second nature.

4
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.370 
My wife thinks I'm out of my mind
spending so much time hunting.

5
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.410 
Same here, but I love it.

6
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.790 
It's a sport that requires patience and focus.

7
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.070 
Things can go out of your hands, and
every moment counts.

8
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.370 
In the end, deer hunting is more than a sport.

9
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.970 
It's about tradition, nature, and connection.

10
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.990 
Whether you're seasoned or new, it's an
experience that keeps bringing people back.

11
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990 
In the United States, it is estimated
that around 6 to 7 million deer are

12
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.390 
harvested each year, primarily in states
like Texas, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

13
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.830 
On average, a harvested deer yields
approximately 50 to 70 pounds, 23 to 32

14
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.570 
kilograms, of consumable meat, depending
on the size and species, such as white

15
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.350 
-tailed deer, mule deer, etc.

16
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.150 
This means the total amount of meat

17
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.790 
harvested annually ranges from 300
million to 420 million pounds, 136

18
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.110 
million to 190 million kilograms.

19
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.350 
That's a significant amount of meat.
