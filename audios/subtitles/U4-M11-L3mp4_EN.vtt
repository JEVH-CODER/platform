1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.220 
So, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.620 
¿Qué estás haciendo?

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.220 
You're watching a video.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.360 
¿Estás viendo un video?

5
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.360 
Now, let's jump right into it.

6
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.500 
Let's watch this video.

7
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.340 
What are you doing?

8
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.260 
What are you doing?

9
00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.460 
Oh, my goodness.

10
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:18.720 
Never, ever do that.

11
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.760 
Nunca hagas eso.

12
00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.240 
But the guy is asking there.

13
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.300 
Él está preguntando ahí.

14
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
What are you doing?

15
00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.840 
¿Qué estás haciendo?

16
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.160 
What are you doing?

17
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.760 
Dilo conmigo.

18
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.580 
What are you doing?

19
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.420 
Pretty good.

20
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.460 
What are you doing?

21
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.520 
¿Qué estás haciendo?

22
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.020 
Mira que el in le da eso de endo.

23
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.800 
Ando.

24
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.080 
Alright?

25
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.820 
For example, over here, en esta frase de aquí.

26
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.420 
We're cooking lunch with some friends.

27
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.180 
Estamos cocinando el almuerzo con algunos amigos.

28
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.000 
Say with me.

29
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.760 
We're cooking lunch with some friends.

30
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.680 
Pretty good.

31
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.320 
Once more.

32
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.400 
We're cooking lunch with some friends.

33
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.920 
That's great.

34
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.420 
That's great.

35
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.140 
You could also say, I like to cook.

36
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.760 
Me gusta cocinar.

37
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.920 
Now, that way, it's okay.

38
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.620 
Está bien.

39
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.900 
Pero no suena tan nativo.

40
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.340 
Alright?

41
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.660 
So, para que suene más nativo, utilizamos
el ing.

42
00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.300 
¿Cómo?

43
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.700 
Mira.

44
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.960 
Así como aparece aquí.

45
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.620 
I like cooking.

46
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.600 
Me gusta cocinar.

47
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.100 
I like cooking.

48
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.060 
Dilo conmigo.

49
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.520 
I like cooking.

50
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.300 
Pretty good.

51
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.280 
Con ese ing.

52
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.080 
En vez de to, pones ing.

53
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.540 
Alright?

54
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.080 
I like to cook.

55
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.360 
Se convierte en I like cooking.

56
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.680 
Pretty good.

57
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.180 
Now, let's check another phrase over here

58
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.500 
is to make a house a home.

59
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.680 
Hacer de una casa un hogar.

60
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.220 
You know?

61
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.700 
A house es más el edificio.

62
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.380 
Esto te va a quedar claro una vez para
que diferencies house y home.

63
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.880 
House es más el edificio.

64
00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.940 
La pared.

65
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.280 
Alright?

66
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.380 
That is a house.

67
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.340 
Esta es una casa.

68
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.020 
Okay?

69
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.360 
And a home es más como un hogar.

70
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.280 
Las personas que viven en ella.

71
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.100 
The brother.

72
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
The sister.

73
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.840 
The father.

74
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.400 
The mom.

75
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.760 
Alright?

76
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.660 
You know, parents and kids.

77
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.940 
Eso es más la home.

78
00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
El hogar.

79
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.720 
So, to make a house a home es como crear
un hogar dentro de una casa.

80
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.060 
Alright?

81
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.340 
Tener un hogar dentro de esa casa.

82
00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:09.380 
Dilo conmigo.

83
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.100 
To make a house a home.

84
00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.260 
Pretty good.

85
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.840 
Once more.

86
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.680 
To make a house a home.

87
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
That's excellent.

88
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.240 
Excellent.

89
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.420 
Next up we got, I've made dinner for us.

90
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.940 
Alright?

91
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.380 
I've made dinner for us.

92
00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.840 
Nos he hecho la cena.

93
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.880 
Now, what about you doing dinner for

94
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.600 
everybody today?

95
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.560 
¿Qué piensas de hacer la cena para todos hoy?

96
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.040 
Think about it.

97
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.440 
Si te animas, dale.

98
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.360 
Y cuando lo hagas, diles a todos.

99
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.960 
I've made dinner for us.

100
00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.300 
He hecho la cena para nosotros.

101
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.700 
Okay?

102
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.060 
I've made dinner.

103
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.520 
Hice la cena.

104
00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.880 
I've made dinner.

105
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:48.440 
Dilo conmigo.

106
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.800 
I've made dinner for us.

107
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.940 
Pretty good.

108
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.920 
That's awesome.

109
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.240 
Now, we have, they're making dinner in

110
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.740 
the kitchen.

111
00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.120 
Ellos están haciendo la cena en la cocina.

112
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.720 
Dilo conmigo.

113
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.320 
They're making dinner in the kitchen.

114
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.240 
Pretty good.

115
00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.020 
That's awesome.

116
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.660 
Once more.

117
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.440 
They're making dinner in the kitchen.

118
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.320 
That's right.

119
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.880 
That's right.

120
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.140 
Now, making sería entonces haciendo.

121
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.560 
Alright?

122
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:17.480 
Make.

123
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
Make.

124
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.380 
De hacer.

125
00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:19.320 
Making.

126
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.380 
Haciendo.

127
00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.860 
Now, we have over here.

128
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.420 
Let's check out this video.

129
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.100 
I'm going home.

130
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.680 
I'm going home right now.

131
00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.720 
I'm going home.

132
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.280 
I'm going home right now.

133
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.280 
I'm going home.

134
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.880 
I'm going home right now.

135
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.500 
Alright?

136
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.060 
She's saying, I'm going home.

137
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.140 
Está diciendo, me voy para la casa.

138
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.480 
Okay?

139
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.860 
Voy a casa.

140
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.600 
Dilo conmigo.

141
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:40.560 
I'm going home.

142
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.080 
Pretty good.

143
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.600 
Once more.

144
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.700 
I'm going home.

145
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.060 
That's right.

146
00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.420 
I'm going significa que voy a ir o estoy
yendo a.

147
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.220 
For example, I'm going to work.

148
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.240 
See you later.

149
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.840 
Voy a trabajar.

150
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.840 
Nos vemos luego.

151
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.260 
Okay?

152
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.920 
Most of you may drive.

153
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.140 
And you know, so you can commute to your work.

154
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.000 
So you can work.

155
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.400 
La mayoría de las personas drive,
conducen para ir al trabajo.

156
00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.920 
So you could say, I'm going to work.

157
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.640 
See you later.

158
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.880 
Voy a trabajar.

159
00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.660 
Nos vemos luego.

160
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:09.200 
Dilo conmigo.

161
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.140 
I'm going to work.

162
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.920 
See you later.

163
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.070 
All right.

164
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.690 
But some people, like this guy over here,
have the privilege of working from home.

165
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.990 
Hay algunas personas como este señor, que
tienen el privilegio de trabajar desde la casa.

166
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.210 
Now, of course, I guess people don't
worry about that.

167
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.090 
Obviamente sé que muchos no trabajamos
desde la casa de esa forma.

168
00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.470 
But, all right.

169
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.870 
Let's check out this phrase.

170
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.350 
Tom is working from home today.

171
00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.750 
Tom trabaja hoy desde casa.

172
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.270 
All right?

173
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.730 
O Tom hoy trabaja desde casa.

174
00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.970 
Se puede decir de ambas formas.

175
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.290 
Tom is working from home today.

176
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.310 
Dilo conmigo.

177
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.150 
Tom is working from home today.

178
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:53.690 
That's great.

179
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.210 
That's great.

180
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.230 
Now, does your company let you work from home?

181
00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.010 
Tu empresa te deja trabajar desde la casa.

182
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.810 
Write it in the comments below.

183
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.110 
Escribe allá abajo en los comentarios.

184
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.950 
Does your company let you work from home?

185
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.050 
Pretty good.

186
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.950 
Now, this girl over here.

187
00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.810 
Oh, she's like saying.

188
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:13.830 
Ella está como diciendo.

189
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.910 
I'm tired.

190
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.170 
I'm going to bed now.

191
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.150 
Estoy cansada.

192
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.650 
Voy a la cama.

193
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.730 
Voy a dormir ahora.

194
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.910 
So, dilo conmigo.

195
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.910 
I'm tired.

196
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.370 
I'm going to bed now.

197
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.390 
Pretty good.

198
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
I'm tired.

199
00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.270 
I'm going to bed now.

200
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:32.590 
That's awesome.

201
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.330 
That's awesome.

202
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.950 
Eso significa que estás cansado de que
vas a la cama.

203
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.430 
Espero que no lo estés justo ahora.

204
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.410 
But, just in case, eso es una frase que

205
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:42.770 
puedes utilizar en otro momento del día.

206
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.310 
Now, we got this over here.

207
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.850 
It's I'm staying at home.

208
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.270 
Dilo conmigo.

209
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.670 
I'm staying at home.

210
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.510 
Pretty good.

211
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.150 
I'm staying at home.

212
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.130 
Excellent.

213
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.410 
Eso significa me estoy quedando en casa.

214
00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:57.790 
And, good news.

215
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.090 
For today, we've learned more than 55
words and more than nine English expressions.

216
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.230 
We've also practiced pronunciation,
listening, and cultural takeaway.

217
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.150 
Remember, you're making progress every day.

218
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:10.410 
So, congratulations.

219
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.410 
Congrats.
