1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.740 
or clarity.

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:03.940 
For clarity, let's outline our goals for

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:04.600 
the project.

4
00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.680 
For accuracy, please double -check the

5
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.940 
figures before submission.

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.920 
As mentioned before, we need to

7
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.580 
prioritize our resources, that is, the
project is on hold, that is, we cannot

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.120 
proceed until further notice.

9
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.260 
In detail, I will explain the procedure

10
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:29.820 
in detail during the meeting.

11
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.260 
To go into detail, the project involves

12
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.220 
several phases.

13
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.460 
To finish up, let's review what we've discussed.

14
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.060 
Wrapping it up, we've made significant
progress today.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.880 
In conclusion, we should implement the
proposed changes.

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.300 
As a final thought, let's remember the
importance of teamwork.

17
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.420 
In closing, thank you all for your contributions.

18
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.080 
As a final point, we need to ensure all

19
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.440 
team members are informed.

20
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.080 
Summing up, our efforts have led to

21
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.300 
remarkable improvements.

22
00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.360 
All things considered, it has been a

23
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.280 
successful year.

24
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.200 
To draw to a close, I want to thank

25
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.660 
everyone for their hard work.

26
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.680 
To finalize, we need to finalize the

27
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.200 
plans by the end of the week.

28
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.020 
In opposition, in opposition to the

29
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.520 
proposed changes, several community
members voiced their concerns.

30
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.500 
Contrary to this, contrary to this
belief, research shows otherwise.

31
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.340 
Standing against, standing against the
tide of popular opinion, she voiced her concerns.

32
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.940 
Notwithstanding, notwithstanding the
challenges, we achieved our goals.

33
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.700 
While, while the project is ambitious, it
is achievable.

34
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.380 
Even still, even still, we must remain
cautious about our approach.

35
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.680 
With respect to this, with respect to
this issue, we need to conduct further analysis.

36
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.060 
As opposed to, as opposed to traditional
methods, we are adopting a new approach.

37
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.060 
Other than, other than the delay, the
project is on track.

38
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.640 
While it may be, while it may be
difficult, we must strive for excellence.

39
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.960 
Disagreeing with, disagreeing with the
majority, he presented an alternative perspective.

40
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.460 
Despite being, despite being new to the
team, she quickly adapted.

41
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.700 
Objecting to, objecting to the proposal,
the committee raised several concerns.

42
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.660 
On another note, on another note, I would
like to discuss our upcoming events.

43
00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.820 
By contrast, by contrast, last year's
results were significantly lower.

44
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.180 
With an opposing view, with an opposing
view, he argued against the majority opinion.

45
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.960 
Going against, going against the trend,
she chose to pursue her own path.

46
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.220 
Diverging from, diverging from the
original plan, they found a more

47
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.260 
effective solution.

48
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.580 
Unlike, unlike her peers, she prefers to

49
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.480 
work independently.

50
00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.300 
In defiance of, in defiance of the

51
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.420 
warnings, they continued their expedition.

52
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.560 
Only if, we will proceed only if we

53
00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.100 
receive the necessary approvals.

54
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
As long as, as long as we work together,

55
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.720 
we can achieve our goals.

56
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.620 
To the extent that, to the extent that

57
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.120 
resources allow, we will expand our services.

58
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.080 
Provided that, we will proceed with the

59
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.400 
project, provided that funding is secured.

60
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.340 
Restricted to, the offer is restricted to

61
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.060 
members only.

62
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.340 
Insofar as, insofar as we can determine,

63
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
the results are promising.

64
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.780 
In part, the success is due in part to

65
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.740 
the team's dedication.

66
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.660 
To a limited degree, the changes have

67
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.700 
improved efficiency to a limited degree.

68
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:24.280 
So far as, so far as I know, the meeting

69
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.780 
is still scheduled for tomorrow.

70
00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:27.620 
Within bounds.

71
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.060 
The discussion remained within bounds and
was productive.

72
00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.740 
Merely.

73
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.120 
She was merely suggesting an alternative approach.

74
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.740 
Solely.

75
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.000 
The project was funded solely by donations.

76
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.940 
Up to a point.

77
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.940 
I agree with you up to a point, but I

78
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:46.920 
have some reservations.

79
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
With certain limitations.

80
00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.020 
The proposal can be implemented with
certain limitations.

81
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.040 
Conditioned by.

82
00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.860 
The outcome is conditioned by various

83
00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:58.940 
external factors.

84
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.760 
Dependent on.

85
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.900 
Success is dependent on the team's performance.

86
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.940 
In the event of.

87
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.980 
In the event of an emergency, follow the
evacuation plan.

88
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.300 
Pending.

89
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.520 
The decision is pending approval from the board.

90
00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.280 
Under conditions.

91
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.260 
The experiment will be conducted under

92
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.420 
controlled conditions.

93
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:22.260 
Restricted by.

94
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.900 
The program is restricted by budgetary constraints.

95
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.580 
Surprisingly.

96
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.420 
Surprisingly, the team exceeded their
sales targets this quarter.

97
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:34.460 
Astonishingly.

98
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.840 
Astonishingly, the results showed a 50 %

99
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.180 
increase in productivity.

100
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.040 
Shockingly.

101
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.580 
Shockingly, the company reported its
first loss in five years.

102
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.500 
To my dismay.

103
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.720 
To my dismay, I found out that the event

104
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:51.520 
had been cancelled.

105
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.900 
Much to my surprise.

106
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.960 
Much to my surprise, the quiet student
delivered an impressive presentation.

107
00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.940 
Out of the blue.

108
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.060 
Out of the blue, she received a job offer

109
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.200 
from a prestigious firm.

110
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
To my amazement.

111
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.660 
To my amazement, the simple solution
resolved the complex issue.

112
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.880 
Unexpectedly.

113
00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.700 
Unexpectedly, the weather changed,

114
00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.700 
forcing us to cancel our plans.

115
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.440 
Incredibly.

116
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
Incredibly, they completed the project
ahead of schedule.

117
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:26.740 
Much to my frustration.

118
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.700 
Much to my frustration, the software

119
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:31.100 
still had several bugs.

120
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.800 
In fact.

121
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.620 
In fact, studies show that regular
exercise improves mental health.

122
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.880 
As a matter of fact.

123
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.780 
As a matter of fact, I have been working

124
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.560 
on this project for over a year.

125
00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.920 
Indeed.

126
00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.760 
Indeed, many experts agree on the
importance of early education.

127
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.280 
To be precise, the deadline is next
Friday at 5pm.

128
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.720 
In particular, I enjoy outdoor
activities, in particular hiking and cycling.

129
00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.660 
Not to mention, the new policy will
reduce costs, not to mention improve

130
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.820 
employee satisfaction.

131
00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:12.700 
Incidentally.

132
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
Incidentally, I ran into our old neighbor yesterday.

133
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:18.680 
Above all.

134
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.060 
Above all, we must prioritize the safety
of our employees.

135
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.940 
Worth mentioning.

136
00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.520 
It's worth mentioning that we achieved

137
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.880 
our goals ahead of time.

138
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.440 
Notably.

139
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.160 
Notably, the research highlights the
importance of diversity in the workplace.

140
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.640 
It's essential to add.

141
00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.520 
It's essential to add that teamwork plays

142
00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.120 
a crucial role in our success.

143
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:43.880 
As highlighted.

144
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.280 
As highlighted in the report, customer
feedback is invaluable.

145
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.420 
Most importantly.

146
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.500 
Most importantly, we must adhere to

147
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:54.740 
safety regulations.

148
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.680 
In terms of.

149
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.740 
In terms of performance, this quarter has
been our best yet.

150
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:02.720 
Shifting focus.

151
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:05.740 
Shifting focus to customer needs is

152
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:06.980 
essential for our growth.

153
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:08.780 
Speaking of.

154
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:12.760 
Speaking of the budget, we need to
discuss potential cuts.

155
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:14.960 
From my perspective.

156
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.940 
From my perspective, the results speak

157
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.800 
for themselves.

158
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.840 
If you ask me.

159
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.400 
If you ask me, we should invest more in training.

160
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.560 
The way I see it.

161
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:30.460 
The way I see it, collaboration is key to success.

162
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:32.240 
To my mind.

163
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.980 
To my mind, we have all the tools we need
to succeed.

164
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:38.440 
As far as I'm concerned.

165
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.360 
As far as I'm concerned, the discussion

166
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.460 
is far from over.
