1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.280 
Going on with the story.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.380 
Finally, the chosen common destination

3
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.120 
was the United States
.

4
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.320 
Everyone started packing their bags.

5
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.860 
Some were over the moon because it was

6
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.560 
the country of their dreams, while others
did so with a heavy heart, knowing that

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.080 
the journey to this country would be no
walk in the park.

8
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.500 
Still, there was a shared feeling among
them that no one wanted to admit.

9
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.240 
Uncertainty.

10
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.280 
Will we make it?

11
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.080 
They all wondered.

12
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.760 
Since there were so many people, it

13
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.240 
wasn't safe to travel all together in one
go, so they split into two different options.

14
00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.340 
Hit the road.

15
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.200 
They would use cars and motorcycles up to

16
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.860 
a certain point.

17
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
After that, they would hoof it for seven

18
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.000 
weeks to reach the meeting point.

19
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.560 
Take to the water.

20
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.740 
They would raft it across the sea,
arriving in about four weeks.

21
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.560 
Some preferred to reach their destination
overland, imagining they might find some

22
00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.320 
pit stops along the way.

23
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.500 
Plus, they were terrified of the water

24
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.780 
since they didn't know how to swim.

25
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.780 
They figured the bears and pumas roaming

26
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.140 
those jungles would be spooked by such a
large group.

27
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.740 
Others decided to set sail by water.

28
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.820 
Fewer risks of getting mugged, and the

29
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.700 
journey would be a lot quicker.

30
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.260 
Much smarter.

31
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.260 
Much smarter.
