The younger son, who wanted to explore
the world, took his share of the state

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.460 
and went to a distant country.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.800 
There he spent all of his money on

5
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.040 
reckless living, enjoying the pleasures
of life without thinking about the future.

6
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.620 
Why did the younger son leave his house?

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.260 
So he got up and went to his father.

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.920 
While he was still a long way off, his
father saw him and was filled with compassion.

9
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.960 
He ran to his son, embraced him and
kissed him.

10
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.660 
How did the father react when he saw his
younger son returning?

11
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.520 
Third, the older brother became angry and
refused to go in.

12
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.260 
So his father went out and pleaded with him.

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.400 
Why did the older brother refuse to join

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.080 
the celebration?

15
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.420 
I want to see your questions in the comments.
