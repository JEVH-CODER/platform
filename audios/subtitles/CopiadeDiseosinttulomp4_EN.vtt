even more today.

One boy slid too fast and has slid
cautiously since then.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.180 
They stood there yesterday too and have
stood in the same spot all week.

27
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.940

Earth.

30
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.120 
Some stuck there from last year and have

31
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.740 
stuck firmly despite the wind.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.680 
They swept the main area this morning and

40
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.520 
have swept every corner of the carnival
to keep it clean.

41
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:16.200

43
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.200
