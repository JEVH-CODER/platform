Christopher before she leaves?

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.380 
Why do you think Christopher agrees to
his mother's instructions, even though he

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
enjoys freedom and playing outside?

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.730 
What would you do if you were left in

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.390 
charge of your siblings for a day?

6
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.070 
Would you follow the instructions, or

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.190 
would you take a risk?

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.200 
Why do you think Christopher's friends

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.880 
are encouraging him to leave the house?

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.610 
decision to go to the beach?

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.430 
What would you do if your friends

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
pressured you to go somewhere against
your parents' wishes?

14
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.350 
Would you be able to say no?

15
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.960 
Why do Christopher's friends think he's

16
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.420 
faking his distress in the water?

17
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.710 
Why do the friends choose not to help

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.610 
Christopher and instead run away?

19
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.600 
What would you do if you were in

20
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.100 
Christopher's position, struggling in the
water with friends who didn't take you seriously?

What emotions does Edith experience when

23
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.700 
she finds out that Christopher has left
the house?

24
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.150 
Why do you think the other children's
parents deny knowing where Christopher went?

25
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.620 
How does the neighbor's information
change Edith's response?

26
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.620 
What might she be feeling when she learns
Christopher went to the beach?

27
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.710 
What emotions do you think Edith
experiences during her search for

28
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.790 
Christopher at the beach?

29
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.550 
What would you do if a family member went missing?

30
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.230 
What steps would you take, and whom would
you reach out to for help?

31
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.540 
Do you think Edith might have done
something differently to prevent

32
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.640 
Christopher's disappearance?

33
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.560 
Why or why not?

34
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.280 
How does Christopher survive his ordeal,
and who helps him?

35
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.310 
Why do you think Christopher doesn't
remember what happened during his time in

36
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.650 
the jungle?

37
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.790 
What would you do if you were Christopher

38
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.330 
and were found by strangers after being
lost for days?

39
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.540 
How does Christopher change after his experience?

40
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.160 
Why do you think he becomes more responsible?

41
00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.760 
How might this experience affect how
Christopher interacts with his friends in

42
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.140 
the future?

43
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.480 
What would you do if you were reminded of

44
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.380 
a past mistake every time you saw a
specific place?

45
00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.180 
Would it change your behavior or decisions?
