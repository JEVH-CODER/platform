00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.480 
Once upon a time, on a boat gently moving
under the sun, lived a man named Ben, his

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.300 
wife Sarah and their daughter Lily.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.100 
They had made this boat their home, but

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.780 
it was more than just a place to live.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.480 
It was their jam, inside, behind worn

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.200 
wooden walls.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.440 
They had a small clothes factory.

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.440 
Ben had always wanted to work for
himself, and, well, the boat idea just clicked.

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.020 
It was a risky move, but they took the
chance, and now they were producing the

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.080 
most unique, handcrafted clothes.

11
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.040 
This is where their story begins, where

12
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.860 
work, family, and secrets weave together
like threads in a fabric.

13
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.780 
Every day, they moved the boat near small
coastal towns, offering their clothes to

14
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:44.600 
curious visitors.

15
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.780 
Who knew you could make a whole factory

16
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
fit on a boat?

17
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.020 
People would often say, staring in

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.940 
disbelief, Ben always smiled and replied,
Well, when pigs fly, you'll see a factory

19
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.360 
that works harder than this one.

20
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600 
Lily, now 17 years old, had lived on the

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.660 
boat her whole life.

22
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.180 
She knew its creaks, its sounds, and the

23
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.240 
salty air that filled every corner.

24
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.220 
She loved to play on the deck, sometimes

25
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.480 
imagining they were on an adventure in
far -off lands.

26
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.640 
One day, as they finished their last
piece of clothing for the week, Sarah

27
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.820 
called Lily inside.

28
00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.800 
Come help me fold these shirts.

29
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.240 
We've got a big order tomorrow.

30
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
How big?

31
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.200 
Lily asked, curious.

32
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.400 
About 500 shirts.

33
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.720 
Her mother replied, her hands moving swiftly.

34
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.080 
I hope we get it done in time.

35
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.920 
Ben, listening from behind them, sighed,
If we keep cutting corners, we're going

36
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.320 
to have to go back to square one.

37
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.960 
We've already burned the midnight oil

38
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.140 
three times this week.

39
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.140 
Sarah stopped folding and looked at him.

40
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.100 
Don't worry.

41
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:54.660 
We'll make it work.

42
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.200 
We always do.

43
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
The nights on the boat were quiet, with

44
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.440 
the occasional sound of the waves beneath them.

45
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.080 
But one night, something changed.

46
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.820 
It was a calm evening.

47
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.640 
Lily had just turned off the lights and

48
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.560 
was about to fall asleep when she heard it.

49
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.060 
A soft bump against the side of the boat.

50
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.640 
She sat up, her heart racing.

51
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.620 
Dad?

52
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.940 
She called out softly.

53
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:20.380 
No answer.

54
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.320 
Cautiously, she tiptoed outside.

55
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.820 
There, near the back of the boat, she saw

56
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.600 
something or someone moving in the shadows.

57
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.260 
What do you mean, someone

58
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.480 
?

59
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.320 
Ben exclaimed the next morning, as Lily

60
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.380 
told her parents what she saw.

61
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.320 
I swear, there was someone there.

62
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.120 
I couldn't see them clearly, but I'm not
making this up.

63
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.420 
Lily said.

64
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.340 
Her voice high -key shook.

65
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.420 
Ben and Sarah exchanged worried glances.

66
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.800 
Okay.

67
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.480 
Sarah said calmly.

68
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.680 
Maybe it's nothing, but we'll keep an eye out.

69
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.100 
Let's not get salty over it
.

70
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.020 
Over the next few days, strange things
started to happen

71
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.160 
.

72
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.660 
A batch of shirts, which had been neatly

73
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.100 
folded, appeared out of place.

74
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.320 
Once, they even found a shirt completely

75
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.920 
soaked, despite having left it dry under
the roof.

76
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.900 
Lily would wake up in the middle of the
night, hearing footsteps outside her room.

77
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.500 
This is getting sus.

78
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.880 
She whispered one morning to her dad.

79
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.820 
What do you mean?

80
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.740 
Ben asked, glancing over at Sarah.

81
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.380 
How could there be anyone on board
without us noticing?

82
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.680 
I don't know, but it's vibing way off.

83
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.500 
That afternoon, they decided to search

84
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.940 
every inch of the boat.

85
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.860 
They looked under every shelf, behind

86
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.160 
every curtain, but found nothing, until
Ben opened the storage room door.

87
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.860 
There, inside, hidden behind the boxes of
fabric, they found an old man.

88
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.740 
His clothes were ragged, his face worn by
the sea, and his eyes wide with fear.

89
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.080 
What the?

90
00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
Ben muttered, backing up.

91
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.540 
Sarah gasped, and Lily stood frozen.

92
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.260 
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.480 
The old man said, holding up his hands.

94
00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

95
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.020 
I've just been hiding here for a few days
.

96
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.260 
Please, don't kick me out.

97
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.700 
Who are you?

98
00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.620 
And what are you doing here?

99
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.560 
Sarah asked her voice firm.

100
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.560 
My name is Tom.

101
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.700 
I used to live in these waters, but I

102
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.340 
lost everything.

103
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.440 
I saw your boat, and I thought I could,

104
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.000 
you know, hide.

105
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.820 
I didn't want to bother you, I swear.

106
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
Ben was speechless, but Lily felt a
strange sympathy for the man.

107
00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:52.080 
Dad.

108
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.980 
She whispered, Maybe we could help him.

109
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:57.180 
No way.

110
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.660 
Ben replied, shaking his head.

111
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.380 
We're not running a charity here.

112
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.020 
But Sarah thought for a moment.

113
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.780 
Why don't you work with us for a while
?

114
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.180 
You can help with the clothes, and once
you've earned enough, we'll let you go.

115
00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.540 
Tom's eyes lit up.

116
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.360 
I'd be so grateful.

117
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.560 
He said, his voice low -key desperate.

118
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.100 
Weeks passed, and Tom became part of

119
00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.360 
their routine.

120
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.100 
He worked hard, sewing and cutting,

121
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.540 
making the most out of what little he had.

122
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.380 
But Lily would ask him questions all the time.

123
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.600 
How old are you?

124
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.280 
She asked once.

125
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.520 
Sixty -two.

126
00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:38.080 
He replied.

127
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.000 
I've been on these waters for as long as
I can remember.

128
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.820 
But as time went on, more secrets began
to spill.

129
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.900 
Lily overheard Tom talking to someone on
the radio late one night.

130
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.460 
Could you say that again?

131
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.460 
He whispered from the shadows.

132
00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.100 
He repeated something about a shipment,
about someone coming to take the boat.

133
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:00.960 
Lily felt her heart skip a beat.

134
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.060 
She went straight to her parents.

135
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.820 
Tom isn't who he says he is.

136
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.780 
He's planning something, something big.

137
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:13.060 
I heard him say they're coming for the boat.

138
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.500 
Ben, now suspicious, decided to confront Tom.

139
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.940 
What's really going on here?

140
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.180 
He demanded the next morning.

141
00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.040 
Tom, caught off guard, stuttered.

142
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.320 
I didn't want to involve you.

143
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.220 
I owe a lot of people a lot of money.

144
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:31.580 
They've been chasing me, and I thought,

145
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.920 
maybe this boat could save me.

146
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.100 
And now they're coming for us?

147
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.540 
Sarah asked, her voice sharp.

148
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.940 
Tom hung his head.

149
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.200 
Yes.

150
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.640 
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:46.880 
I didn't mean for this to happen.

152
00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.700 
The family had no choice.

153
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.480 
They packed up their things and moved the
boat further out to sea, hoping to avoid

154
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:55.860 
the danger coming their way.

155
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.340 
But deep down, they knew they were on

156
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:58.900 
thin ice.

157
00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.240 
Tom had brought trouble into their lives

158
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:02.160 
.

159
00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:03.540 
And the question now was, how long could

160
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
they escape it?

161
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.580 
I don't know.

162
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.700 
And my head was very close to accessing her.

163
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.700 
Father of Israel.

164
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.740 
I can all be going to take my phone right now.

165
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 
I want to do No in my head before the day before.

166
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.760 
I want to keep going to see everyone like that.
