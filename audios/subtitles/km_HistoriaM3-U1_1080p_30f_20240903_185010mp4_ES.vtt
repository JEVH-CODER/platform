00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.020 
I can't just wait around.

2
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.780 
Hi, Valeria.

3
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.860 
David told me he was going to visit a
friend yesterday, but he hasn't called me

4
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.560 
since then.

5
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.300 
I'm really worried too.

6
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.440 
Who was this friend?

7
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.700 
I didn't know he was going to meet anyone yesterday.

8
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.820 
I don't know, but he seemed worried.

9
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
I have never seen him so worried before.

10
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.880 
What?

11
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.260 
But he was very calm yesterday before dinner

12
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.360 
.

13
00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.900 
Do you remember Daniel?

14
00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.080 
He's the person who can help us.

15
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.200 
What?

16
00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.140 
The school's dean?

17
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.060 
Are you kidding me?

18
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.960 
What can he know about my brother?

19
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.400 
Well, he was very close to Daniel.

20
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.200 
I'll go to the park today.

21
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.280 
That's the place where they usually meet.

22
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.960 
I'll ask him if he knows something about Daniel.

23
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.540 
All right.

24
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.400 
Be careful.

25
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.200 
That Daniel is a womanizer.

26
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.890 
He flirts with everyone.

27
00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.270 
Valeria arrives home and receives a call.

28
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.210 
Miss, please come.

29
00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.590 
We want you to identify a suspicious body.

30
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.830 
Oh, no!

31
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.590 
Oh, no!

32
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.590 
Oh, no!
