Put your answers to the questions in the
comments below.

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:03.420 
First one.

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.200 
Do you know which story that is?

4
00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:06.000 
Said the pastor.

5
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
It sounds like the prodigal son's story,

6
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:08.960 
said Valeria.

7
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.460 
Which story does Valeria think the pastor

8
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.320 
is referring to?

9
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.980 
Second.

10
00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.740 
Are you supporting my parents?

11
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.400 
She asked, her voice trembling with a mix

12
00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.960 
of disbelief and anger.

13
00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.000 
How can you say that?

14
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.940 
David has always been a good person.

15
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.780 
Why does Valeria become upset with the pastor?

16
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.440 
One should always try to help others meet.

17
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.740 
But you've done a lot already, Valeria.

18
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.480 
The pastor said gently.

19
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.120 
Sometimes, love means knowing when to let go.

20
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
What does the pastor suggest Valeria
should do for David?

21
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:40.520 
Pretty good.

22
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.140 
I'll wait for your answers in the

23
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.680 
comments below.
