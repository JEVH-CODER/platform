00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.240 
Hi, hi.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.280 
Welcome to this new lesson.

3
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.640 
For today, we're going to be learning
about I don't, I don't.

4
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.720 
So, don't, lo puedes utilizar, puedes
decir I don't, para cuando tú sabes que

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.540 
no haces algo.

6
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.500 
Por ejemplo, I don't sing very well.

7
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:24.120 
No canto muy bien.

8
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.760 
I don't sing very well.

9
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.580 
Sin cantar very well, muy bien.

10
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.200 
I don't sing very well.

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.600 
Pretty good, pretty good.

12
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.200 
Again, I don't sing very well.

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.460 
Excellent.

14
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.240 
Watch this video.

15
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.520 
I'm sorry, let me do it again.

16
00:00:47.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
No suena bien, ¿verdad?

17
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
It doesn't sound well.

18
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.880 
No suena bien.

19
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.820 
It doesn't sound well.

20
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.630 
It doesn't sound well.

21
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.200 
Pretty good, pretty good.

22
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.900 
Nice, nice.

23
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.780 
So, I don't sing.

24
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.360 
Miro los videos, los clips.

25
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:46.440 
I don't sing.

26
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.760 
I don't sing.

27
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.440 
I don't sing.

28
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.920 
I don't sing.

29
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.240 
Pretty good, excellent.

30
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.700 
So, now, we don't eat pork.

31
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.420 
Pork es cerdo, ¿sí?

32
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.560 
Carne de cerdo.

33
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.760 
Entonces, we don't eat pork.

34
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.280 
Nosotros don't eat pork.

35
00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.780 
Nosotros no comemos cerdo.

36
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.280 
We don't eat pork.

37
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.750 
Excellent.

38
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.970 
Pretty good, pretty good.

39
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.230 
We don't eat pork.

40
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.280 
Nice, nice, excellent.

41
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.280 
Así que ahí estás viendo, por ejemplo,
los judíos.

42
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.680 
They don't eat pork.

43
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:20.720 
No comen pork.

44
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.660 
Carne de cerdo.

45
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.000 
Or, the Lemba tribe.

46
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.100 
O, algunos de sus descendientes, como los
Lemba, la tribu de los Lemba, que tampoco

47
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.040 
eat pork.

48
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.460 
Pretty good, pretty good.

49
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.560 
So, this one.

50
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.660 
You don't know who I am.

51
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.020 
You don't know who I am.

52
00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.960 
Quiere decir, no sabes quién soy.

53
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.460 
Tú no sabes quién soy.

54
00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.120 
Okay?

55
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.480 
So, you don't know who I am.

56
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.320 
Excellent.

57
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.820 
Pretty good.

58
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.740 
Again, you don't know who I am.

59
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.840 
Nice, nice.

60
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.160 
Watch these clips and listen.

61
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.020 
Because you don't know who I am.

62
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.820 
Because you don't know who I am.

63
00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.760 
I know you don't know who I am, but I
know you.

64
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.800 
I know you don't know who I am, but I
know you.

65
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.460 
Has somebody ever told you that?

66
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.520 
¿Alguien alguna vez te ha dicho eso?

67
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.960 
Write it in the comments below.

68
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.140 
Say it in the comments.

69
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.980 
You don't know who I am.

70
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.320 
Okay?

71
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:16.700 
Let's check out the next one.

72
00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.180 
It is, he doesn't speak Russian.

73
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.120 
He doesn't speak Russian.

74
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.500 
Entonces, el no, he doesn't speak Russian.

75
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.740 
Speak Russian.

76
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.860 
Russian, ruso.

77
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.440 
He doesn't speak Russian.

78
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
Excellent, excellent.

79
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.160 
Again, he doesn't speak Russian.

80
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.390 
Nice.

81
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.790 
He doesn't speak Russian.

82
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.050 
Pretty good, pretty good.

83
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.470 
So, today we have learned something
really wonderful.

84
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.490 
Remember to use these phrases.

85
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.990 
Recuerdo usar estas frases.

86
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.470 
For example, I don't.

87
00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.230 
Por ejemplo, I don't.

88
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.430 
When you want to say you don't do something.

89
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.330 
Cuando quieres decir que no haces algo.

90
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.850 
Okay?

91
00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.730 
So, that was everything.

92
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.190 
And see you.

93
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.730 
Bye bye.
