Mia Hurts For Those In Need
She hurt deeply when she saw homeless

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.760 
people last winter and has hurt quietly
for years, motivating her volunteer work.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.480 
She leads a local charity now.

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.480 
She led a successful fundraising campaign

5
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.580 
last year and has led many community
projects since then.

6
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.080 
Mia lends a helping hand to everyone she
can.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.580 
She lent her car to a neighbor in need
last week and has lent support to

8
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.560 
countless individuals.

9
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.760 
She rides her bike to volunteer sites.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.780 
She rode 10 miles to a shelter yesterday
and has ridden hundreds of miles for

11
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.640 
charity this year.

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.960 
The sun rises early and so does Mia.

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.220 
It rose at 5 a .m.

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.000 
this morning and she has risen with it

15
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.320 
every day this summer
.

16
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.620 
Mia shoots videos for the charity's website.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.840 
She shot an inspiring documentary last

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.800 
month and has shot many promotional clips
this year.

19
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.260 
Sometimes, Mia's heart sinks when she
sees suffering.

20
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.860 
It sank when she visited a rundown school
last week, but her spirit has sunk only

21
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.760 
momentarily before rising again with determination.

22
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.600 
She tears apart every challenge that

23
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.260 
comes her way.

24
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.180 
She tore her jacket while rushing to an

25
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.680 
important meeting yesterday, but her
dedication has torn apart doubts about

26
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.480 
her leadership.

27
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.260 
Mia throws herself into her work.

28
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.900 
She threw a big charity event last month
and has thrown her whole heart into

29
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.760 
making a difference.

30
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.800 
She wears the charity's t -shirt like a

31
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.760 
badge of honor.

32
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.680 
Yesterday, she wore it to an interview

33
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.320 
and she has worn it for years, reminding
her of her journey.
