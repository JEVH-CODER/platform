Marta and Alberto have a 35-year-old daughter named Sandra. She's killing it in her career and

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
has a job to die for. She's respectful and super responsible. Everything any parent could dream of.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But they're tearing their hair out because she's not married and doesn't even seem to give a

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
hoot about it. So they cooked up a plan. Hire someone to nudge her while she's chilling at her

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
favorite coffee shop. Let's check out this scene at the cafe. Hey, what's up? Not much you.

6
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
All good. I see you're a coffee fan, huh? Yeah, I'm obsessed. And you've been here before,

7
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
like this cafe's your jam. Yep, I grab a coffee here every morning. Cool. I'd love to get the

8
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
lowdown on you. Uh, okay, that's kind of random, but shoot. So are you hitched? Nah, not yet.

9
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Then you've got a boyfriend, right? Nah, not yet. I'm flying solo right now.

10
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But you've been married before, right? Like divorced or something. Nope, always been single.

11
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh my gosh, how old are you? I'm 35. You're totally missing the boat, girl. Don't you ever feel lonely?

12
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Nah, I've got a pet, so. But do you really think a pet can take the place of a lifetime partner and

13
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
replace a human being?
