1
00:00:00.137 --> 00:00:02.390 
- Today. I want you to get to know me

2
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:03.223 
a little bit better.

3
00:00:03.223 --> 00:00:05.226 
This is my twin sister!

4
00:00:05.226 --> 00:00:06.500 
(laughs)

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.333 
- What?

6
00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:08.166 
Weirdo.

7
00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:08.999 
- You wanna say hi to the channel?

8
00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.130 
- Hi channel.

9
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.130 
- That's what, hi channel?
- Why are you laughing at me?

10
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.450 
- Say who you are!

11
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.570 
- I'm Dasha Varshavski.

12
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.420 
- And what are you? What are
you, what do you represent?

13
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.253 
I'm a mom.

14
00:00:17.253 --> 00:00:18.170 
- Of?

15
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.012 
- I'm a business woman.

16
00:00:19.012 --> 00:00:19.845 
- I'm a mom of?

17
00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:21.890 
- Oh, Steven, Daniel and Ari.

18
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.070 
- Who you've seen on the channel.

19
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.350 
She made them. Isn't
that crazy? They came out

20
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.183 
of her.

21
00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:27.970 
- The doctor ties and cuts the cord.

22
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.750 
- Sam's going to ask you a
question and you're going to try

23
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.610 
and see if you know the right
answer to see if you know me.

24
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.960 
How long have you known me?

25
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.733 
- Too long?

26
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.210 
- Let's get started because
this is going to get awkward

27
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.043 
really fast.

28
00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:37.876 
Peewoop!

29
00:00:37.876 --> 00:00:38.709 
- You have to do that by the way.

30
00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:39.760 
- Peewoop!

31
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.800 
- Good. Not bad.

32
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.210 
- [Sam] What year was Mike born?

33
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.510 
Three, two, one.

34
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.840 
- Oh, she did get that.

35
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.830 
I know what year you're born.

36
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.496 
Do you want me to say it?
- No.

37
00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:50.420 
(laughs)

38
00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.370 
- How many piercings does Mike have?

39
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.670 
- What if he didn't tell
me? He kept it away from me.

40
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.640 
- Three, two, one.

41
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.473 
- Imagine I said five.

42
00:00:57.473 --> 00:00:58.500 
- Oh my god.

43
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.333 
- What'd you judge me?

44
00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:00.166 
- Yeah. Totally.

45
00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:00.999 
- Why?

46
00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:01.832 
- Five piercings?

47
00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:02.665 
- Yeah.

48
00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:04.447 
- When you were kids, what was the worst?

49
00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:06.690 
- When I was a kid, and she was an adult.

50
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.950 
- When you were younger growing up,

51
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.400 
what was the worst thing Mike
ever did to get in trouble

52
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.300 
with your parents?

53
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.335 
- Oh, I know. I know. I know. I know.

54
00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:17.360 
- What did I do?

55
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.070 
- Oh. I think I know
what she's going to say.

56
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.903 
Well, whatever.

57
00:01:19.903 --> 00:01:21.868 
This act costs me a
quarter million dollars.

58
00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:22.980 
- Well I'm erasing this.

59
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.660 
- I don't think you
know the right. (laughs)

60
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.343 
- Three, two, one.

61
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.340 
- I knew she was going to say that.

62
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.760 
I knew you were going to say that.

63
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.810 
- I mean, that was the worst thing.

64
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.130 
- Yeah, but they never got in trouble.

65
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.227 
- He punched you in the
stomach. You took two or three

66
00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.260 
of his teeth out.

67
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.350 
- Is that not self-defense?
This is the right answer

68
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.580 
because when my dad found
out that I got a tattoo,

69
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.290 
he was going to pay for my med school.

70
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.850 
And then he said, guess what?

71
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.870 
Not paying for your med school.
Cause you, I got a tattoo.

72
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.990 
- He said he used it as an
excuse. He didn't have the money.

73
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.200 
- Sorry. You knew that?

74
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.390 
- Yeah.

75
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.720 
- This one. I don't know
anything in my family.

76
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.700 
- What was Mike's AOL instant
messenger screen name?

77
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.910 
- AIM? I know this one.

78
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.130 
- Remember that sound?

79
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.133 
The door closing.

80
00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.883 
(making weird sound effects)

81
00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:07.925 
- What?

82
00:02:07.925 --> 00:02:09.333 
- Three, two, one.

83
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.210 
- Did you just write Mr. Mike Funny?

84
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.250 
- Something like that.

85
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.670 
- It's Mister Funny Mike.

86
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.580 
- It doesn't count.

87
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.413 
- It's very close.

88
00:02:17.413 --> 00:02:18.246 
- Sam.

89
00:02:18.246 --> 00:02:19.079 
- I think that counts.

90
00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.160 
- I mean, how close could it be?

91
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.430 
- Who puts the adjective after the noun?

92
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.120 
You don't even know what AOL stands for.

93
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.250 
- I don't know. It's true.

94
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.676 
- Who is Mike's celebrity crush?

95
00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:31.840 
- Oh man.

96
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:32.870 
That's a hard one.

97
00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.410 
- This marker smells.

98
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.243 
(music)

99
00:02:35.243 --> 00:02:36.076 
- Huh?

100
00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:36.909 
- What?

101
00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.510 
I've never once had a
crush on Angelina Jolie.

102
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.773 
After she took away.

103
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:42.663 
Brad.

104
00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:43.510 
Bradiston?

105
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.460 
She broke up Brad and Jennifer.
So I was so sad about that.

106
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.130 
- Okay.
- Do you know who this is?

107
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.150 
- Eva Mendes of course.

108
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.983 
- Who?

109
00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:51.816 
- She's looks, actress.

110
00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:53.691 
- Name a movie she was in.

111
00:02:53.691 --> 00:02:54.540 
(sigh)

112
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.373 
- Fast and furious?

113
00:02:55.373 --> 00:02:57.830 
- No! Yes she was. Wait, was she?

114
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.250 
- Keep your eyes on the rode, cowboy.

115
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.010 
- If Mike were not a
doctor, what would he do

116
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.840 
for a, his a career? What's his job?

117
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.724 
- If you say magic Mike,
I won't talk to you.

118
00:03:05.724 --> 00:03:06.632 
(laughs)

119
00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:07.465 
(music)

120
00:03:07.465 --> 00:03:08.298 
- What?

121
00:03:08.298 --> 00:03:09.131 
- What?

122
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:09.964 
- Detective?

123
00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:10.797 
- Sports agent?

124
00:03:10.797 --> 00:03:13.280 
- You will make the worst detective ever.

125
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.850 
You can't even pay attention to anything.

126
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.890 
How?

127
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:17.723 
Detective?

128
00:03:17.723 --> 00:03:18.970 
- Do you know what I do for a living?

129
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.191 
- They send you a text.

130
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:22.841 
( mimicking Mike)

131
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.800 
- What does a sports agents do?

132
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.020 
- They represent clients.

133
00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.930 
They work in sport agency,
you know, management.

134
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.253 
- Why would you think I
would want to do that?

135
00:03:29.253 --> 00:03:31.680 
- Because you like sports.
You're like athlete.

136
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.100 
- So why don't you say
I would be an athlete?

137
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.850 
- Because you're not going
to be a good athlete.

138
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.683 
- Why?

139
00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.550 
- Well you don't have a, stamina for that.

140
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.980 
How do you know about my stamina?

141
00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.880 
This just got really
weird. Okay, let's move on.

142
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.700 
- When was the last time Mike
was admitted to the hospital?

143
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.810 
- Is that include mental?

144
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.092 
- I look like a lizard.

145
00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:52.092 
(music)

146
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.243 
- Did you just make it up? Why
2009? What happened in 2009?

147
00:03:59.243 --> 00:04:01.550 
- I don't know. Maybe for like tonsillitis

148
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.710 
or something or sinusitis?

149
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.610 
- I've never had a sinus
infection in my life.

150
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:06.510 
- Something like that.

151
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.530 
I remember dad once said you
were like in the hospital

152
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.363 
for a night.

153
00:04:09.363 --> 00:04:11.173 
- I've never been in a
hospital for a night.

154
00:04:11.173 --> 00:04:12.880 
- Some kind of itus.
- I've never had any itus.

155
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.680 
I had wisdom teeth removed.

156
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.720 
- Well this technically is wrong.

157
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.553 
- Why?

158
00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:18.713 
- You were admitted when you were born?

159
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.923 
- Does that count?

160
00:04:20.923 --> 00:04:21.940 
- Yeah. And I was going to write that.

161
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.840 
- So yours is wrong too?
- Yes.

162
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.673 
- Okay.

163
00:04:24.673 --> 00:04:28.560 
- What was the first social
media platform Mike was ever on?

164
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.150 
- I'll tell you a line to
make it easier for you.

165
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.170 
It said like interested in and
you're supposed to put male

166
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
or female and instead I put
chicks, but not baby chickens.

167
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.790 
Quote unquote.

168
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.250 
Cause I was like 12 and I
shouldn't have been on that site.

169
00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:42.677 
- Three, two, one.

170
00:04:42.677 --> 00:04:43.710 
(music)

171
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.120 
- What was that?

172
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.190 
- Whimit?

173
00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.487 
- It was a Russian social media.

174
00:04:49.487 --> 00:04:50.610 
- No.

175
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.800 
- Yes.
- I feel bad for you.

176
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.853 
- What is Mike's favorite
part of his body?

177
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.823 
- That's weird.

178
00:04:57.823 --> 00:04:58.656 
- That is weird.

179
00:04:58.656 --> 00:04:59.489 
That's a weird question.

180
00:04:59.489 --> 00:05:01.550 
- Well we know it's not hair, so.

181
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.600 
- What's wrong with my
hair? Cause it's great?

182
00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.630 
- No, cause you always (mumbles)

183
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.300 
I just don't like it.
You don't like my hair.

184
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.090 
You don't like your hair. You
have a thing against hair.

185
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.703 
- This is Russian
disinformation at its finest.

186
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.560 
- He's writing a lot on body parts.

187
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.770 
- No, it's one body part.

188
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.470 
Well, I actually have two of them.

189
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.370 
- All right, here we go.

190
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.610 
- Three, two, one.

191
00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.610 
- What?

192
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:24.443 
- See?

193
00:05:24.443 --> 00:05:25.276 
- Ear lobes?

194
00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:26.970 
- Feel how soft that ear lobe is.

195
00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:27.803 
Feel it.

196
00:05:27.803 --> 00:05:29.600 
- What is wrong with you?

197
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.270 
- No, be honest. Tell
me it doesn't feel good.

198
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:32.103 
- Weirdo.

199
00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:32.936 
- Tell me it doesn't feel good.

200
00:05:32.936 --> 00:05:35.420 
- What is my least
favorite part of his body?

201
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.590 
- I can uh.

202
00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.020 
- Be honest, dude.

203
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.130 
Just be honest and stay consistent.

204
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.127 
- I don't know what
you're saying right now.

205
00:05:43.127 --> 00:05:44.190 
(laughs)

206
00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.410 
- You always complain about your hair!

207
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.613 
- I have a little head.

208
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.456 
- What?
- I have a little head.

209
00:05:50.456 --> 00:05:51.289 
- Oh my God.

210
00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.360 
- No, I have a little head.

211
00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.193 
You don't know that?

212
00:05:54.193 --> 00:05:57.590 
- Did you not show people
your hair? The spiky?

213
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.700 
- Do you know why I did that?
Because I had a little head.

214
00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.303 
So to extend it, I did spike.

215
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.860 
- He's got Dyson.

216
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.693 
- I'm, I'm.

217
00:06:04.693 --> 00:06:06.340 
- All these tools. No
girls have what you have.

218
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.608 
- Look at the camera.

219
00:06:07.608 --> 00:06:10.690 
Video. I'm six foot
three, 200 plus pounds.

220
00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:12.660 
Your head is almost bigger than mine.

221
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.210 
- That's cause the way I'm sitting.

222
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.043 
- How are you sitting?

223
00:06:15.043 --> 00:06:16.710 
Your head is still
almost bigger than mine.

224
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.550 
That's a problem.

225
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.797 
- What is Mike's best
quality as a brother?

226
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.510 
(music)

227
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.450 
- What?

228
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.480 
- I think it's the height.

229
00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.800 
You always asked me to reach
for stuff, change light bulbs.

230
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.070 
And I could always reach
them 'cause I'm tall.

231
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.440 
- When was the last time
you changed a light bulb?

232
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.300 
- You asked me to do something
in your apartment the other

233
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.740 
day and I did it. You were
like, can you reach this thing,

234
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.747 
and I was like, yeah no problem.

235
00:06:34.747 --> 00:06:36.413 
- For like a salad bowl?
- Yeah.

236
00:06:36.413 --> 00:06:39.290 
- That was once in a lifetime.
- Yeah but that's height.

237
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.100 
But I appreciate you saying
I'm generous and loyal.

238
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.693 
- What is Mike's best quality as an uncle.

239
00:06:43.693 --> 00:06:45.780 
(music)

240
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.917 
- They both start with an S.

241
00:06:46.917 --> 00:06:48.930 
- Yeah and they have P.

242
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.060 
- And they have P.

243
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.940 
- And R and T

244
00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.460 
- And T.

245
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.907 
So we were thinking along the same thing.

246
00:06:53.907 --> 00:06:54.940 
- So, yeah.

247
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.890 
- Mike, how are you a sporty uncle?

248
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:57.723 
- Because I play sports with the kids.

249
00:06:57.723 --> 00:06:59.380 
- True.

250
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:00.870 
- I didn't really put
that much thought into it.

251
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.870 
- On a scale of one to 10. One
being small, 10 being large.

252
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.220 
How big is Mike's ego?

253
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.603 
- Three, two, one.

254
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.837 
- Did you say 9.5?

255
00:07:13.837 --> 00:07:15.290 
- Yes.

256
00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.100 
- Do you know what I said?

257
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.140 
- Yeah.

258
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.973 
3.1.

259
00:07:18.973 --> 00:07:19.806 
Apparently.

260
00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:21.610 
- Hold on a second. Do you
not see the whole number?

261
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.050 
- Yeah. What is it? A pi or something?

262
00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.145 
- Yeah.

263
00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:25.460 
(laughs)

264
00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.610 
- What does that mean?

265
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.650 
- Pi.

266
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.590 
- What does that mean?

267
00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.630 
- It's a never ending number,

268
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.630 
but it's a low number.

269
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.810 
Can you even give one example
to back up? Give me evidence.

270
00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.410 
- Right now? Look at you.

271
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.590 
- I'm offended.

272
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.423 
- Exactly.

273
00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:42.270 
- What is the dumbest
thing Mike ever bought?

274
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.420 
- That that's pretty easy.

275
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.633 
- Three, two, one.

276
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.297 
- I didn't. Whatever.

277
00:07:47.297 --> 00:07:49.000 
Why is that a bad purchase?

278
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.027 
It was my childhood dream
car. I'm allowed that.

279
00:07:50.027 --> 00:07:52.750 
- 'Cause you, you build
your life around the car.

280
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.220 
Bear can't get in the car.
- Bear can get in the car.

281
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.300 
- Kids can't get in the car.

282
00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.630 
- Bear can get in the
car even if there's kids.

283
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.360 
- The car is inaccessible.

284
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.750 
Oh, I don't have spot seats in the back.

285
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.040 
I can't put your bags in the
grocery shopping because there

286
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.663 
is no spot in the car.
- I will say, this is.

287
00:08:07.663 --> 00:08:08.496 
- It's the most useless purchase.

288
00:08:08.496 --> 00:08:10.130 
- I will say, this is so embarrassing.

289
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.363 
- And you can't even speed in New York.

290
00:08:11.363 --> 00:08:13.980 
- So like two years ago,
I was dating somebody

291
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:14.813 
and they flew in.

292
00:08:14.813 --> 00:08:15.646 
- Yes.

293
00:08:15.646 --> 00:08:17.700 
- And I was like going to
pick them up at the airport.

294
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.550 
And I was like, can I be a gentleman?

295
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:21.000 
Pick them up at the airport.

296
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.890 
And then I realized they
wrote a big piece of luggage.

297
00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.150 
I can't fit in my car.

298
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:27.550 
So I had to go to an Uber and
I had to ask the Uber to drive

299
00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.460 
her luggage to my apartment.
And then he followed me.

300
00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.293 
She's like,

301
00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:32.640 
why are you making me drive
a piece of luggage into

302
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.473 
Manhattan?

303
00:08:33.473 --> 00:08:34.306 
- Exactly.

304
00:08:34.306 --> 00:08:35.139 
- And I said, don't worry about it.

305
00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:37.000 
And he said, why? And
I said, look at my car.

306
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.983 
And he said, okay got it.

307
00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:40.440 
- What is this bags for GFS? What is GFS?

308
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.527 
- You don't know what a GFS is?

309
00:08:41.527 --> 00:08:42.610 
- No

310
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:44.030 
- Okay. How about this?

311
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.257 
- Girlfriends? But that's nice.

312
00:08:45.257 --> 00:08:46.213 
That's being generous.

313
00:08:46.213 --> 00:08:48.810 
- So when I spoil myself and I get a car

314
00:08:48.810 --> 00:08:50.090 
for going through med school

315
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.040 
and all this stuff. That's me.

316
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.598 
- How many bags have you purchased?

317
00:08:52.598 --> 00:08:53.431 
- Six?

318
00:08:53.431 --> 00:08:56.357 
- You could've purchased
10,000 bags for girlfriends

319
00:08:56.357 --> 00:08:58.237 
and your sister by the way.

320
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.200 
- How old were you when
the tattoo thing happened?

321
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.033 
- Eighteen.

322
00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:04.920 
- That's not a kid. That's
fully age. Huh! Lost.

323
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.960 
That is not a kid by no definition.

324
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.180 
- Yeah it is. Jewish religion.

325
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.237 
- Well, you're not even Jewish.

326
00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:11.270 
(talking fast)

327
00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:12.110 
- I don't know.

328
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:14.130 
- I would never date Angelina Jolie.

329
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.280 
Unless in fact she offered
to date me then I would.

330
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.540 
Eva Mendes though is with Ryan Gosling.

331
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.940 
- Yeah. I would have guessed that.

332
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:22.330 
- Do you like Ryan Gosling?

333
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:23.220 
- Love that's.

334
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.203 
- Is that you celebrity crush?

335
00:09:24.203 --> 00:09:26.060 
Hold on a sec. Can we split them up?

336
00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:29.100 
The Varshavski family
comes after Ryan Gosling

337
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.730 
and Eva Mendes. Homewreckers.

338
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.120 
- Did you give him a cheat cheat sheet?

339
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.960 
- Cheat sheet of what? They
are questions about me?

340
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.896 
- That was a joke dumb a**.

341
00:09:36.896 --> 00:09:38.180 
(laughs)

342
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.480 
- You look a lot like Ari.

343
00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.880 
- Oh, that's a compliment.

344
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.890 
Thank you.

345
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.690 
- I just said you look a boy but okay.

346
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.340 
Well. Officially I clearly
won all of these rounds,

347
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.770 
but if you want to see my
videos, sshhh, with the nephews,

348
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.580 
the ones that came out of
her, all three of them.

349
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:57.050 
We have many videos. Click
