00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.000 
Back in 1966, there was a young boy named Benny Carson who lived in Detroit.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000 
Benny was not very good at school, and this made his classmates laugh at him.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000 
One day he got really angry and hit one of them in the head.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000 
This made his mother Sonia Carson get called into the principal's office.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000 
After the meeting, Benny felt really sad.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000 
He thought that he was not smart.

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000 
His mother, however, believed in him.

13
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
She told him that he was not stupid, but very smart and that he just needed to work harder.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000 
Still, she was worried.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000 
She did not want her sons, Ben and Curtis, to end up with jobs that they did not like,

16
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000 
because they weren't doing well in school.

17
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
To help Benny do better, Sonia started helping him with his schoolwork.

18
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000 
This is when she found out that Benny was having trouble seeing.

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000 
She quickly got him glasses, which helped him do better in school.

20
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000 
Benny often felt that he was not as good as his classmates, but Sonia always told him

21
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000 
to concentrate on his studies.

22
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000 
Benny's life changed when he went to a church service one Sunday.

23
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000 
The pastor told a story about a brave doctor who helped poor people, even though it was

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000 
dangerous.

25
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000 
This story really touched Benny and made him want to become a doctor who helps others.

26
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000 
Sonia was dealing with a lot of personal troubles.

27
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000 
She regularly visited a psychiatrist and she told him about her hard life.

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000 
She spent her childhood in foster care, without a real family.

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000 
At just 13, she married Carson.

30
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000 
Later she found out that Carson had another family that he hid from her, despite their

31
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000 
best efforts.

32
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000 
Their marriage fell apart and ended in divorce.

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000 
Now Sonia works multiple jobs, like cleaning and babysitting, to support her family.

34
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000 
Sonia can't read or write, and this scares her.

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000 
She's worried that her sons might end up facing the same challenges.

36
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000 
She even tells her psychiatrist about her thoughts of ending her life, which worries

37
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000 
him.

38
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000 
He suggests that she should spend some time in a hospital for her mental health.

39
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000 
During dinner, Sonia tells her sons that she will have to be away for a few weeks.

40
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000 
She doesn't tell them why, but she urges them to concentrate on their schoolwork, because

41
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000 
she believes that getting a good education is the key to a better life for them.

42
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
While Sonia is in the hospital, her son Benny keeps his promise to her.

43
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000 
He starts working harder in school.

44
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000 
His hard work pays off when he receives his first A grade.

45
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000 
When Sonia comes home from the hospital and Benny shows her his grade, she feels so proud

46
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000 
of him.
