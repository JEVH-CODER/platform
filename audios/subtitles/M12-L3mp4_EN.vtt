00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.260 
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.880 
We are going to have a very interesting question.

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.220 
What do you usually do on weekends?

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.600 
What do you usually do on weekends?

5
00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.500 
¿Qué haces usualmente en los fines de semana?

6
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
So, what do you usually do on weekends?

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.360 
Pretty good.

8
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.840 
Again, what do you usually do on weekends?

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.540 
What do you usually do on weekends?

10
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.420 
Pretty good.

11
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.740 
Nice.

12
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:43.560 
So, you can say, I usually try to get

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.240 
lots of sleep.

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.740 
I usually try to get lots of sleep.

15
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.780 
Normalmente, suelo tratar de dormir mucho.

16
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.140 
I usually try to get lots of sleep.

17
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.660 
So, I usually try to get lots of sleep.

18
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.760 
You?

19
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.930 
Pretty good.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.410 
Excellent.

21
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.910 
Nice.

22
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.130 
Once again, I usually try to get lots of sleep.

23
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.980 
Pretty good.

24
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.500 
Nice.

25
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.380 
Now, I usually play football on Sundays.

26
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.180 
I usually play football on Sundays.

27
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.020 
You?

28
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.970 
Pretty good.

29
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.010 
Once again, I usually play football on Sundays.

30
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.510 
Excellent.

31
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.230 
Watch the video.

32
00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.980 
I usually hang out with friends.

33
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.200 
You?

34
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.060 
Excellent.

35
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.580 
Pretty good.

36
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.340 
Once again, I usually hang out with friends.

37
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.650 
Pretty good.

38
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.950 
Nice.

39
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.870 
I usually hang out with friends.

40
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.670 
I usually take a shower.

41
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.510 
Suelo ducharme.

42
00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.450 
I usually take a shower.

43
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.050 
I usually take a shower.

44
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.530 
Repeat.

45
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.150 
Pretty good.

46
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.450 
Excellent.

47
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.250 
One more time.

48
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.630 
I usually take a shower.

49
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.740 
Pretty nice.

50
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:32.100 
Nice.

51
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.880 
Now, sometimes there's people that they
don't take showers while weak because

52
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.960 
they say that, you know, they don't have
any time.

53
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.220 
So, they try to take showers on weekends.

54
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.540 
Although, I think this is not your case,

55
00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.840 
and I hope it's not your case.

56
00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.120 
So, there are people who don't like to

57
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.840 
bath or say that they don't have time to
bath for a week.

58
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.980 
And they only bath for the weekend.

59
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.440 
Okay?

60
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.500 
So, it can also be a phrase for them.

61
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.820 
I usually take a shower.

62
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.400 
I usually take a shower.

63
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.380 
Pretty good.

64
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.420 
So, upload an image to the class
representing what you usually do on weekends.

65
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.460 
Upload an image to the class.

66
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.780 
Pon una imagen en el flub que represente

67
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.940 
la respuesta a la pregunta.

68
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.280 
What do you usually do on weekends?

69
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.980 
Okay?

70
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.820 
So, the goals achieved today were 22

71
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.800 
words, 5 phrases, and vocabulary speaking
and listening developed.

72
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.320 
Remember that every step you take forward
is a victory.

73
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.120 
So, keep on going.

74
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.860 
Okay?

75
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.060 
Remember to comment the class and rate

76
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.360 
Haz el comentario y la valoración de la clase.

77
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.940 
Bye, bye.

78
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.440
