6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.540 
Welcome to today's debate on whether

7
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.440 
governments should have the authority to
prohibit social media in their country.

8
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.220 
We have two panelists, Alex who will
argue in favor of prohibition and Jamie

9
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.620 
who will argue against it.

10
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.420 
Let's begin with opening statements

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.800 
.

12
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.280 
Thank you.

13
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.640 
To start, I would like to highlight that,
in the past, several governments have

14
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.580 
used various means to control the flow of information.

15
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.360 
For instance, back in the early 2000s,

16
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.760 
some governments used to restrict
internet access during times of political unrest.

17
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.960 
This history suggests that it is not
unprecedented for governments to exert

18
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.940 
control over digital platforms.

19
00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.740 
Looking to the future, governments might

20
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
be about to implement stricter
regulations on social media due to

21
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
increasing concerns about misinformation
and security.

22
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.320 
Social media platforms are often seen as
breeding grounds for harmful content,

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.080 
which can lead to significant social unrest.

24
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.040 
Governments could, therefore, have the

25
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.680 
obligation to intervene to maintain
public order.

26
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.760 
Thank you, Alex.

27
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.260 
While it's true that some governments

28
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.560 
have intervened in the past, it's crucial
to consider the implications of such actions.

29
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.720 
The prohibition of social media would
likely lead to unintended consequences.

30
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.100 
For example, when governments prohibited
social media in the past, the results

31
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.500 
were often counterproductive.

32
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.380 
People found alternative methods to

33
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.720 
communicate and share information,
sometimes even making the situation worse.

34
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.160 
Speculating about the future, if a
government were to ban social media, it

35
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.820 
could face considerable backlash from the
public and international community.

36
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.120 
The necessity to preserve free speech and
the right to access information might

37
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.420 
outweigh the perceived benefits of such a prohibition.

38
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.340 
But we must not ignore the fact that

39
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.460 
social media can spread harmful content
that can have real -world consequences.

40
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.700 
For instance, social media platforms were
used to incite violence in various countries.

41
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.500 
If governments have the authority to
regulate these platforms, they would be

42
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.820 
able to prevent the spread of dangerous content.

43
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.860 
In this case, governments would have to

44
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
act, despite the potential backlash.

45
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.000 
While it's important to address harmful

46
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.940 
content, banning social media might not
be the most effective solution.

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.540 
Governments should instead focus on
improving digital literacy and creating

48
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.260 
regulations that target the misuse of
social media without completely

49
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.540 
prohibiting it.

50
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.440 
The right approach would be to balance

51
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.700 
regulation with the preservation of free speech.

52
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.940 
Moreover, the argument that prohibiting

53
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.160 
social media would lead to increased
underground activity doesn't necessarily

54
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.920 
hold water.

55
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420 
Negative adverbials aside, the primary

56
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.940 
concern is the safety and security of the public.

57
00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.520 
By controlling what is shared online,

58
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.900 
governments could prevent the
dissemination of harmful information.

59
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.020 
Nonetheless, considering the present, it
is vital that governments find a way to

60
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.140 
adapt to the digital age without
resorting to extreme measures.

61
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.260 
The future of social media and its role
in society should be managed with careful

62
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.820 
thought rather than sweeping bans.

63
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.480 
The government's role should be about

64
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.380 
finding balanced solutions that uphold
democratic values while addressing

65
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.260 
genuine concerns.

66
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.800 
In conclusion, while a complete ban on

67
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.860 
social media might be a drastic measure,
governments may need to consider it as

68
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.240 
part of a broader strategy.

69
00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.760 
The need for security might justify such

70
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.320 
actions in specific circumstances
, even though it is an approach that

71
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.960 
should be used with caution.

72
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.120 
In summary, it is crucial to approach the

73
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.840 
issue with a nuanced perspective.

74
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.000 
The future of social media regulation

75
00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.120 
should involve a combination of
strategies rather than an outright ban to

76
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.340 
ensure that freedom of expression is
preserved while addressing legitimate concerns.

77
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.200 
Thank you, Alex and Jamie, for your
insightful arguments.

78
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.460 
This concludes our debate on whether the
government can or should prohibit social

79
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.600 
media in their country.

80
00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.080 
Take care and I'll see you in the next one.
