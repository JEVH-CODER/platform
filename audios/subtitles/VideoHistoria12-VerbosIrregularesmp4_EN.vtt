He wounded yesterday and has wound it

3
00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.460 
daily for years.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.520 
Problems often arise in his work.

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.820 
A big story arose unexpectedly yesterday,

8
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.000 
and such situations have arisen
frequently in his career.

9
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.700 
has become well -known in the industry.

12
00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.900 
Sometimes, Jack bets on which stories

13
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:33.620 
will be popular.

has bet correctly many times before.

16
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.360 
Once, while rushing to meet a deadline,

17
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.420 
he cut his finger and it began to bleed.

18
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.380 
It bled for a while, and he has bled from

19
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.140 
paper cuts more times than he can count.

20
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.980 
The local farm he's reporting on breeds

21
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.680 
rare chickens.

22
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.640 
They bred a new variety last season and

23
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.620

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.340 
He's careful not to burn bridges with his sources.

28
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
He burned one connection early in his
career but hasn't burned any

29
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.580 
relationships since then.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.680

34
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100
