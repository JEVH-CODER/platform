00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.900 
Tom was sad.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.780 
His mother and father were always busy.

3
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.740 
The other day, his brother Jack said,
Let's go outside together.

4
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.960 
The weather is nice.

5
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.360 
Tom replied, I'd rather stay inside.

6
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.560 
There's nothing fun out there.

7
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.320 
Jack smiled.

8
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.200 
Brother, that's not true.

9
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.860 
There's something fun everywhere if you look.

10
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.220 
Come on, I'll show you.

11
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.380 
Tom thought for a moment.

12
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.600 
Well, okay.

13
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.940 
It's better than doing nothing.

14
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.120 
When they got home, their parents were there.

15
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.200 
Did you do anything fun today?

16
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.960 
Asked their mother.

17
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.420 
We did everything.

18
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.560 
Tom said happily.

19
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
We played in the park.

20
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.820 
Although I didn't want to go at first,
I'm glad we did.

21
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.880 
Their father smiled.

22
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.080 
That's great.

23
00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.640 
Whether you play inside or out, it's
always good to do things together.

24
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.240 
From that day on, Tom knew that without
his family, life wouldn't be as fun.

25
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.820 
He learned that there was always
something to enjoy no matter what.

26
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.160 
Let's go on.

27
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.200 
We'll be right.

28
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.240 
We'll be right back.
