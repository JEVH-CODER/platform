00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:08.500 
it's a piece of cake it's very easy to do
break a leg good luck hit the nail on the

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:16.740 
head you got it exactly right the ball is
in your court it's your decision now bite

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.840 
the bullet face a difficult situation
bravely burn the midnight oil work late

4
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.520 
into the night caught between a rock and
a hard place in a difficult situation

5
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
with no easy solution don't cry over
spilled milk don't waste time worrying

6
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.620 
about things that can't be changed it's
not rocket science it's not difficult to

7
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.400 
understand a blessing in disguise
something that seems bad at first but

8
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.620 
turns out to be good a dime a dozen very
common and not special barking up the

9
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.480 
wrong tree pursuing a mistaken or
misguided course of action let the cat

10
00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.420 
out of the bag reveal a secret the early
bird catches the worm those who act

11
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.000 
promptly have an advantage every cloud
has a silver lining there's something

12
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.740 
good in every bad situation put all your
eggs in one basket risk everything on a

13
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:27.740 
single venture go the extra mile make a
special effort under the weather feeling

14
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.920 
ill or unwell take it with a grain of
salt don't take it too seriously on thin

15
00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.820 
ice in a risky situation let sleeping
dogs lie don't disturb a situation as it

16
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.520 
is the best of both worlds an ideal
situation curiosity killed the cat being

17
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.480 
too inquisitive can lead to trouble out
of the frying pan and into the fire

18
00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:03.720 
going from a bad situation to a worse one
actions speak louder than words what you

19
00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.360 
do is more important than what you say
bite off more than you can chew take on a

20
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:16.800 
task that is way too big throw in the
towel give up or surrender the grass is

21
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.080 
always greener on the other side people
tend to envy others situations an arm and

22
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.440 
a leg very expensive all bark and no bite
someone who talks tough but isn't

23
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.320 
aggressive the elephant in the room a big
issue that everyone ignores jump on the

24
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
bandwagon join a popular activity or
trend knock on wood say something to

25
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.600 
avoid bad luck let the chips fall where
they may accept the consequences of your

26
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.460 
actions a penny for your thoughts a way
to ask someone what they are thinking you

27
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.360 
can't judge a book by its cover don't
judge based on appearance hit the road

28
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
leave or start a journey in hot water in
trouble to have a chip on your shoulder

29
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.380 
hold a grudge the sky's the limit there's
no limit to what you can achieve throw

30
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:27.420 
caution to the wind take a risk get out
of hand become uncontrolled keep your

31
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:35.560 
chin up stay positive put your best foot
forward make a good impression make a

32
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.640 
long story short tell something briefly
the tip of the iceberg a small part of a

33
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.240 
much larger problem you can't have your
cake and eat it too you can't have it

34
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.460 
both ways a bird in the hand is worth two
in the bush it's better to have something

35
00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.460 
than to risk it for more make ends meet
manage to live on a budget make ends meet

36
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.600 
manage to live on a budget caught red
-handed caught in the act of doing

37
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.460 
something wrong all in the same boat
everyone is facing the same challenge the

38
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.880 
straw that broke the camel's back a minor
action that causes a major reaction a

39
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.860 
taste of your own medicine when someone
experiences the same unpleasantness they

40
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.800 
caused others every rose has its thorn
good things have their drawbacks put the

41
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.620 
cart before the horse do things in the
wrong order don't put all your eggs in

42
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.820 
one basket don't risk everything on one
venture see eye to eye agree on something

43
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.200 
speak of the devil the person we were
just talking about appeared the pot

44
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.880 
calling the kettle black criticizing
someone for a fault you have a fish out

45
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:05.020 
of water a person in an uncomfortable
situation cut to the chase get to the

46
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:12.780 
point under the radar not attracting
attention out of the blue unexpectedly

47
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:20.040 
all in a day's work something that is
expected as part of the job it takes two

48
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.840 
to tango both parties involved are
responsible hit the ground running start

49
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:33.320 
a project with enthusiasm too good to be
true something that seems wonderful but

50
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.380 
probably isn't out of your league beyond
your capabilities a leopard can't change

51
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.820 
its spots people can't change their
character the ballpark figure an

52
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:53.160 
estimated range burning the candle at
both ends working too hard without rest

53
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:59.600 
throw someone under the bus betray
someone for your benefit don't count your

54
00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.540 
chickens before they hatch don't assume
success before it happens hitting the

55
00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.520 
nail on the head describing exactly what
is causing a situation keep your friends

56
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
close and your enemies closer be wary of
those who may do you harm the whole nine

57
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:26.300 
yards everything all the way get your act
together organize yourself know the ropes

58
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.480 
understand how things work barking up the
wrong tree pursuing a mistaken course of

59
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:40.420 
action sitting on the fence not making a
decision fell through the cracks

60
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:47.300 
something that was overlooked it's not
the end of the world don't worry it's not

61
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:54.440 
that serious it's all in your head the
problem is psychological a hard nut to

62
00:06:54.450 --> 00:07:02.580 
crack a difficult problem jump the gun
act prematurely on the same wavelength

63
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.540 
have a similar understanding cry over
spilled milk worry about something that

64
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:15.820 
cannot be changed a stitch in time saves
nine fix a small problem before it

65
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:22.480 
becomes a big one the writing's on the
wall there are signs of trouble ahead cut

66
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:31.020 
corners do something in the easiest way
raining cats and dogs raining heavily get

67
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:35.620 
a taste of your own medicine experience
the same treatment you give others

68
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:43.120 
between a rock and a hard place facing
two difficult choices on cloud nine

69
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:50.560 
extremely happy the whole shebang the
entire situation or collection of things

70
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.500 
steal someone's thunder take credit for
someone else's achievements get down to

71
00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:05.000 
brass tacks focus on the essentials a
flash in the pan a one -time success that

72
00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:12.200 
doesn't last burn the bridges eliminate
the possibility of returning jumping for

73
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:20.680 
joy extremely happy at the end of the day
ultimately don't bite the hand that feeds

74
00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:28.400 
you don't harm those who help you get the
ball rolling start something put your

75
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:34.300 
money where your mouth is support your
words with action a penny saved is a

76
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:40.660 
penny earned saving money is as important
as earning it a rolling stone gathers no

77
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:44.960 
moss a person who doesn't settle down
won't accumulate wealth or

78
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:52.560 
responsibilities rolling with the punches
adapting to difficult situations stabbed

79
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:58.640 
in the back betrayed by someone trusted
like finding a needle in a haystack

80
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:05.400 
extremely difficult to find something a
wolf in sheep's clothing someone who

81
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:11.680 
pretends to be harmless but is dangerous
the calm before the storm a quiet period
