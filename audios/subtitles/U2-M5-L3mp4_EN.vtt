00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.080 
Alright, welcome back to this lesson, I'm
Teacher Junior, and let's check it out

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.560 
right away.

3
00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.040 
So, let's check out the word which.

4
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.440 
Vamos a ver la palabra which.

5
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.780 
A moment before the elevator hits the

6
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.000 
bottom, you will somehow decrease the
impact on your body.

7
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.780 
Firstly, how are you planning to
understand when you should jump?

8
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.600 
You can't see through metal, can you?

9
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.600 
Secondly, even if you somehow manage to

10
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.540 
jump, which is extremely difficult due to
being in a freefall, the speed decrease

11
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.400 
you can hope for is about 2 miles per
hour, or 3 kilometers per hour.

12
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.060 
It's definitely not enough to save your life.

13
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.280 
What is worse, you might hurt yourself

14
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.420 
badly if you hit the ceiling with your head.

15
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
Jumping is not worth the risk at all.

16
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.260 
Mythbusters tested this approach.

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.620 
Believe us, it didn't end well for the

18
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.840 
dummy inside the elevator.

19
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.960 
Standing up straight and hoping for the

20
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.140 
best is also not the best idea.

21
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.640 
Nothing good is coming.

22
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.240 
What is coming is a weight 10 times
larger than that of your own body

23
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.860 
dropping on your legs at the moment of impact.

24
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.500 
Now, with all due respect, neither you

25
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.480 
nor anyone else can survive that.

26
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.960 
So, now that we're clear of what you

27
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020 
should never do in a falling elevator,
let's get to the best course of action.

28
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.200 
Your best bet would be to lie flat on
your back.

29
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.160 
This position will help you distribute
the force of the impact across your

30
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.840 
entire body.

31
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.580 
Yes, your small thin bones will probably

32
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.920 
snap anyway, though it mostly depends on
how high up you were when the cable snapped.

33
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.280 
But it might help you avoid more serious damage.

34
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.200 
Or not.

35
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.880 
Nobody is absolutely certain.

36
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
It's probably pretty hard to think

37
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.440 
clearly in such a situation.

38
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.560 
But you should also remember to cover

39
00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.820 
your head with your hands.

40
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.200 
When the elevator lands, it will most

41
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:21.120 
likely be destroyed.

42
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.420 
So, protecting your head from debris

43
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.660 
might save your life.

44
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
If you're trapped under an avalanche,

45
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.680 
spitting can help you out.

46
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.080 
As soon as you stop moving, make a little

47
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.360 
hole around your face.

48
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.500 
Spit in the air pocket and see where

49
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.020 
gravity carries your saliva.

50
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.780 
Then start making your way out by digging

51
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.140 
in the opposite direction.

52
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.760 
If suddenly you notice that the water

53
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.020 
recedes quickly and unexpectedly from a
beach exposing the ocean floor, you

54
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.300 
should warn everyone around and get away
as fast as you can.

55
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.220 
Because when the waterline is abnormally
far from the shore, this is a sign of a tsunami.

56
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.020 
No air pump and a flat tire is a bad
combo when you're far from home.

57
00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.420 
To fix your bike, grab a bunch of grass
or leaves and evenly pack the tire with

58
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.360 
as much as possible.

59
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.720 
That will be enough to reach a safe place.

60
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.000 
Now, do you know any other tricks to fix
a flat tire without an air pump?

61
00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.440 
Share your wisdom in the comments below.

62
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.540 
If you're under attack by a moose, those

63
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.480 
creatures are huge, try to hide behind a tree.

64
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.980 
Those animals have a blind spot in their

65
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.120 
peripheral vision, so they will lose you
and you can escape easier.

66
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.780 
If a black bear is chasing you, remember
that you shouldn't turn your back on this

67
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.320 
animal or try to run.

68
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.960 
Either of these actions can make them hostile.

69
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.040 
Your best bet is to lie flat on your
stomach to protect your organs, crossing

70
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.440 
your hands behind your neck to guard your
arteries to convince the bear you don't

71
00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.240 
pose any threat.

72
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.140 
Also, don't climb a tree.

73
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.660 
They do it better than you.

74
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.400 
Oh, and if you see Yogi Bear, don't try

75
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.840 
to look like a picnic basket.

76
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.780 
He'll steal you every time.

77
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.260 
For example, over here, de estas
situaciones, which one would you choose?

78
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.380 
¿Cuál escogerías?

79
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.400 
Which one?

80
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.740 
Well, I want you to grab it in the
comments down below.

81
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.320 
Escríbelo allá abajo en los comentarios.

82
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.820 
Which situation would you prefer?

83
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.580 
¿Cuál situación preferirías?

84
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.680 
Alright, so now, repeat after me.

85
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.620 
Repite conmigo.

86
00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.120 
Which city are you from?

87
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.660 
That's great.

88
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.240 
Once more.

89
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.320 
Which city are you from?

90
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.900 
Pretty good.

91
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.760 
That's excellent.

92
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.620 
Now, let's check the next one.

93
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.420 
Vamos a ver cómo puedes responder.

94
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.240 
Tenemos este formato de aquí.

95
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.730 
My hometown is...

96
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:38.150 
Is...

97
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.310 
Y dices tu ciudad.

98
00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:40.950 
En este caso tenemos Reading.

99
00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.450 
It's near London.

100
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.070 
Mi ciudad natal es Reading.

101
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.550 
Y está near, cerca de London.

102
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.410 
Londres.

103
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.650 
Alright, so we already know a little bit
about London.

104
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
Nosotros ya hemos visto algo acerca de London.

105
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.530 
And now we're going to check Reading.

106
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.350 
Vamos a ver este corto video de Reading.

107
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.430 
So, that's great.

108
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.650 
Now, you could say...

109
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:34.770 
Tú pudieras decir...

110
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.510 
My hometown is Reading.

111
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:37.310 
Dilo conmigo.

112
00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.930 
My hometown is Reading.

113
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.170 
Pretty good.

114
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.890 
That's right.

115
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.590 
Once more.

116
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.130 
My hometown is Reading.

117
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.670 
That's great.

118
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:48.190 
That's great.

119
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.090 
Ahora, quiero que lo reemplaces con tu hometown.

120
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.150 
Con tu ciudad natal.

121
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.190 
My hometown is...

122
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.950 
Pretty good.

123
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.670 
Pretty good.

124
00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.330 
Excellent.

125
00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.510 
Now, next up.

126
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.990 
La siguiente que tenemos es...

127
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.210 
Big town and quite small.

128
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:04.950 
Alright?

129
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.550 
Big and small.

130
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.350 
Vamos a ver en este video...

131
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.930 
Cuáles son las cosas más big...

132
00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.390 
Más
grandes...

133
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.090 
Of the universe del universo.

134
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.470 
And what are the things that are quite small.

135
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.090 
Y cuáles son las cosas que son bien pequeñas...

136
00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.610 
In the universe.

137
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:21.890 
Alright?

138
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.690 
Performing a size comparison of the

139
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.630 
entire universe...

140
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:25.290 
Will unearth some

141
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.190 
astonishing facts.

142
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.890 
Let us begin our journey from...

143
00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.150 
Smallest
to Largest.

144
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.510 
Basetime Fabric.

145
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.910 
The Foundation of the Universe.

146
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.430 
Going any smaller than this will defy the
laws of physics.

147
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.250 
Planck Particle.

148
00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.270 
The smallest thing in existence.

149
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.370 
The largest known moon.

150
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.350 
Ganymede.

151
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.990 
Finally, this is us.

152
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.470 
Everyone you know.

153
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:49.830 
Every religion.

154
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.870 
Ideology.

155
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.030 
Conflict.

156
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.370 
Every experience.

157
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.810 
Every saint and sinner in the history of
our species.

158
00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:58.890 
Lives out here.

159
00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.290 
Other planets.

160
00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.970 
The largest being Jupiter.

161
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.230 
Which can fit 1 ,300 Earths inside of it.

162
00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.150 
The Sun.

163
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.430 
A ball of superheated gas.

164
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.070 
Which can fit a million Earths inside of it.

165
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:14.510 
Stars.

166
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.110 
Polaris.

167
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.290 
Polaris.

168
00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.910 
Over 10 ,000 times bigger than our own Sun.

169
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:20.990 
The Pistol Star.

170
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.130 
3 ,000 times bigger than Polaris.

171
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.710 
If this had the same location as our Sun,

172
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.510 
it would reach as far as Mars.

173
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.390 
So, whenever someone asks you, what city

174
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:37.730 
are you from, you could say, I come from
a big town.

175
00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.690 
Para decir, yo vengo de una big, una gran ciudad.

176
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.450 
A town.

177
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:42.750 
Alright?

178
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.250 
Town es también similar a city.

179
00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.350 
Solo que city es más grande que town.

180
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:48.710 
¿Ok?

181
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.670 
So, tenemos city, town y village.

182
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.150 
Ahora, puedes decir, I come from a big town.

183
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.170 
Pretty good.

184
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.690 
Pretty good.

185
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.530 
Si vienes de una big town, de una ciudad
grande, dices eso.

186
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.870 
And now, if you say, si tú vienes de un
pueblo, then you could say, my village is

187
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:08.990 
quite small.

188
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.850 
¿Ok?

189
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.230 
Say it with me.

190
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:11.790 
Dilo conmigo.

191
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.330 
My village is quite small.

192
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.490 
Pretty good.

193
00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.090 
Once more.

194
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.050 
My village is quite small.

195
00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:21.770 
Pretty good.

196
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:22.590 
That's how you do it.

197
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.690 
Eso significa, mi pueblo es bastante pequeño.

198
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.050
