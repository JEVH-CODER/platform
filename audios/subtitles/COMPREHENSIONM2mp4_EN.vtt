Ahora vas a escuchar esta parte de la
historia y vas a responder las siguientes preguntas.

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.016
Can you please describe your brother?

3
00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:13.740
Ok. He’s a good man, though he used to steal my candies when we were little. 


4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.755
And he doesn’t like to take showers. But he likes books, photographs and food.

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.180
Miss, are you kidding me? Can you please help me?

6
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.500
 Describe your brother physically!


7
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.080
Oh, sorry.


8
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:38.220
Why did the cop ask Valeria to describe her brother physically?

Entonces esta pregunta la vas a responder
en un comentario abajo.
