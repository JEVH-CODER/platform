00:00:01.430 --> 00:02:29.320 
we shall overcome we shall oh sing we
shall rejoice stay right there we'll sing

2
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:54.320 
sing and shout we will sing and shout So
finally, Lord, in prayer, we say, fill my

3
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.240 
cup, Lord.

4
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.540 
I lift it up, Lord.

5
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.300 
Fill it up.

6
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:43.300 
And now tonight, God, your people sit at

7
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.880 
your feet.

8
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.920 
Father, they don't sit at my feet because

9
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.460 
there's nothing that's germane in me that
can save anyone or challenge anyone or

10
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.680 
get your people.

11
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.770 
But we sit together at your feet.

12
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:12.870 
We ask you to speak, to feed us, till
we'll want no more.

13
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.730 
So fill my cup, fill it up, and make
me...

14
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.420 
In the mighty name of Jesus, let
all those who love him and can't wait to

15
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
see him say amen.

16
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.020 
Truly humbled to be with you here on this

17
00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.580 
campus at this time.

18
00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.200 
I told you on Thursday morning And I'm

19
00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.520 
going to tell you again Because I've been
saying it since I've been here I really

20
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:29.340 
don't know why You Would invite me I
don't believe that I'm intelligent Or

21
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:44.280 
articulate enough To demand Even a minute
of your time But I do believe That God

22
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:56.750 
uses straight, utter boo -boo garbage
like me and if God would use me then God

23
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:09.030 
would make your time worthwhile so I'm
praying that God will speak I was told by

24
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:22.980 
Ev who's sitting in the second row that
on tonight I would need to declare to

25
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:53.120 
everyone who was here que este lugar es
lit ahora tengo que admitir que tengo no

26
00:06:53.130 --> 00:07:02.440 
idea lo que significa así que si se cuss
por favor me y cuando se ve en la caja

27
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:09.600 
que era de control que era de control y
la espiritual no era de control no no no

28
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.420 
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
no no no no no no no I assume that it's good.

29
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:21.480 
And I have been learning while I've been
here, this has not been a very good trip

30
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.120 
for me.

31
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.800 
It's not been a very good trip.

32
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.340 
And the reason why it's not been a very
good trip is because I'm constantly being

33
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.000 
reminded that I am old.

34
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.920 
It's not okay.

35
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.960 
Jose Borges, it's not okay.

36
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:48.240 
I don't want to be here anymore Porque

37
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:55.000 
I'm being reminded That I'm old You speak
and I don't understand What you are

38
00:07:55.010 --> 00:08:02.860 
saying When people that were in
Deliverance Mass Choir Which by the way

39
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:18.310 
You guys are absolutely, completely And
amazingly phenomenal I think it was some

40
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:27.450 
eight years ago Or some foolishness like
that I was The director of this choir On

41
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:37.830 
this campus It's not good Don't clap
Because now members That were members

42
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:45.740 
with me Have left And then returned
Probably children of my members Singing

43
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:56.180 
in this choir right now It's just I
refuse I will not I'll just leave On

44
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:06.600 
tomorrow My daughter Who was six months
old When we came to this campus turns 10

45
00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:28.420 
it's not good when I came to the campus I
used to lightly line my hairline my

46
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:44.140 
hairline has receded like the sea at low
tide when to be on this campus you said

47
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:49.000 
my god I said my god too that's what I
say when I look in the mirror my god but

48
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:54.460 
don't worry because all y 'all tenors up
in here rocking them high top pros you'll

49
00:09:54.470 --> 00:10:09.710 
be like this soon enough So, for all
those in the house that are rocking the

50
00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.210 
receding hairline, let me hear you say amen.

51
00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:23.470 
You need to come to the campus to realize

52
00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.670 
how old I'm getting.

53
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.330 
I'm about to drop some stuff on you.

54
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:35.270 
See, I was around when there was the
Tandy computer.

55
00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.400 
The Commodore.

56
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.640 
Don't worry.

57
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:51.300 
When you had these little things I still
remember when I was young A track High

58
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:16.890 
speed dubbing on tapes Was the new thing
I remember boom boxes Get a hold of

59
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:33.580 
somebody else You had this square thing
on your hip Called a beeper Remember when

60
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:38.840 
we had cell phones Now, well the cell
phone first came It was a car phone My

61
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.300 
dad, I grew up in Barbados He had a car
phone in a car When there was no cell

62
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:47.640 
phone service in the land And so we would
just drive around And pick up the cell

63
00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:51.680 
phone in the car Even though there was no
cell phone service In the land And we

64
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.160 
would just max and relax Driving downtown
with this phone to our ears Because we

65
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:07.140 
had a cell phone But there was no service
All these changes One of the biggest ones

66
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:20.380 
for me Was I remember Rance McNally This
is becoming embarrassing I need somebody

67
00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:25.120 
in the house to at least pretend That you
know what I'm talking about Thank you

68
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:32.460 
Thank you Thank you very much Rance
McNally When you were leaving Andrews

69
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.080 
University And you were going to drive
home on a road trip You would take out

70
00:12:36.090 --> 00:13:01.700 
the Rance McNally map Plot your way No
Okay Then from Rance McNally MapQuest

71
00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:09.620 
came out ¿Qué es lo que you're thinking about?

72
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.660 
We had to put the stuff into the computer

73
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:25.620 
and it would print out the TomTom.

74
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:30.400 
It wasn't as loud for the TomTom.

75
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.520 
You put in the coordinates and they came
up with this thing called GPS.

76
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.360 
Then from the TomTom, now we got it on
the phone.

77
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.880 
So I got MapQuest on my phone.

78
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.320 
And when I'm taking a long drive going

79
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:54.860 
somewhere, I'll put in the coordinates
into my phone And I'll tell the phone

80
00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:01.890 
where I want to go But there's this new
technology in there That's new to me, not

81
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:09.200 
new to you And it's called rerouting
Where I put in the coordinates for where

82
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:14.780 
it is I want to go But every once in a
while the satellite just looks over my

83
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:20.220 
route And it decides that the way that
I'm going I'm going to run into traffic

84
00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:26.000 
And so what the satellite does Is through
the little voice in my MapQuest That

85
00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:31.400 
comes through my phone The voice tells me
that I'm about to encounter some traffic.

86
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:37.000 
Now because I'm used to Rance McNally
where you actually plot where it is

87
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:37.540 
you're going.

88
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.720 
And you don't turn to the left or to the

89
00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.540 
right because you might get lost.

90
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.780 
I often don't listen to what the little

91
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.640 
voice in my phone tells me.

92
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.760 
When the voice in my phone tells me

93
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.480 
there's traffic ahead.

94
00:14:50.850 --> 00:14:52.440 
There's an accident ahead.

95
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:56.580 
We are going to reroute you to save you
some time.

96
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.980 
I don't listen to what the phone tells
me, and when I don't listen to the phone,

97
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:10.060 
I will often find myself wasting my time
sitting in traffic because I didn't

98
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.320 
listen to the voice in my phone.

99
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.500 
Now, we went all around the hills and the dale.

100
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:20.060 
We talked about A -tracks, and we talked
about high -speed dubbing, but I was just

101
00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:23.860 
kind of lulling you to sleep to bring you
to a point where I want to tell you that

102
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:29.620 
some people in this room, Tonight, God is
going to speak through his GPS, and he's

103
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.140 
going to reroute your life.

104
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:37.100 
Because he sees that there's traffic up ahead.

105
00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.400 
Now, some people in the house are saying,
well, great.

106
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:45.160 
Yes, God, reroute their lives, their lives.

107
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.280 
Reroute them, because I'm holy.

108
00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:48.660 
I wear my suit.

109
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:50.720 
I got three buttons on my suit and not

110
00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.240 
two, and I never walk out the house
without a tie.

111
00:15:54.310 --> 00:16:01.680 
I'm a seminary student Lord I'm here to
do your work And here to do your will So

112
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:07.800 
reroute them Because I'm on the right
path But in Acts chapter 16 There are two

113
00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:13.900 
guys in the book of Acts And Paul and
Silas Are on a journey Can someone say

114
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:19.480 
journey They're on a journey to do a good
thing They're on a journey And they're on

115
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:23.160 
their way They're going to baptize some
people they're going to preach to some

116
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:31.320 
people and some lost people are going to
get saved and all y 'all say amen but the

117
00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:38.100 
Holy Spirit in Acts chapter 16 confronts
Paul and Silas and says to them I know

118
00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:43.700 
what you plan to do and what you plan to
do is a good thing but the thing that

119
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:51.220 
you're planning to do is not my will Paul
and Silas are planning to do a good thing

120
00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:55.700 
They're going to preach the gospel to
people They're going to go to this part

121
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.620 
of the country And everyone is going to
get saved But how many people in the

122
00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:06.580 
house know That a good thing is not
always a God thing So the Holy Spirit

123
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:12.680 
gets involved And the Holy Spirit says
Listen, I have a divine appointment for

124
00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:18.200 
you There's a place that I need you to go
to There's a work that I've called you to

125
00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:23.660 
do Some people in this house or messing
around in the seminary when the Holy

126
00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:30.760 
Spirit has been saying get ye out of
there it's a good thing but it's not a

127
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:36.400 
God thing there's some people that I've
encountered on this campus I've seen you

128
00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:41.160 
on this campus I was here when you were
here I left and I came back and you're

129
00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:46.760 
still here and here you're doing a good
work and it's safe but this is a good

130
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:54.880 
thing but for you sister it's not a God
thing The Holy Spirit walks up in your

131
00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:02.520 
life And reroutes your course Not because
you're doing something wrong But because

132
00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:08.440 
you're not doing what God has purposed
you to do And even when you're doing a

133
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:13.160 
good thing without God How many people
know that when you do a good thing

134
00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:18.760 
without God You can create as much damage
as if you were doing an evil thing

135
00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:26.000 
because you're not where your purpose to
be so tonight as we talk tonight I'm

136
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:31.540 
praying that you will reanalyze your life
and ask yourself is there some place

137
00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.140 
where the Holy Spirit said go right and
you chose to go left because the traffic

138
00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:40.480 
up ahead looked good to you tonight I
want to ask you to listen to that voice

139
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:45.860 
as God reroutes your life and says
there's something that I want you to do

140
00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:51.140 
the Holy Spirit got up in this mix Paul
and Silas have plans And Paul and Silas

141
00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:54.700 
say listen God this is what we're going
to do This is what we're going to do This

142
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:58.540 
is what we're going to achieve Cliff This
is what we plan to do The Holy Spirit

143
00:18:58.550 --> 00:19:03.500 
comes in And the Holy Spirit says I know
what you plan to do It's a good thing But

144
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:08.060 
it's not a God thing There's some place
that I want you to go There's someone in

145
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:12.560 
the building today That is sitting in
your seat That is doing some major And

146
00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:16.760 
God says what you're doing is a good
thing But it's not what I purposed you to

147
00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:23.700 
do I got some place for you to go I got
someone for you to meet So Paul and Silas

148
00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:31.040 
The Bible says immediately They listen to
the voice of God And they respond

149
00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:37.460 
Immediately You know There's some people
in my church that I will not pray for

150
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:46.550 
They make an appointment And I let them
know I'm unavailable And the reason why

151
00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:51.090 
is because there are times when God says
something to you about what you're

152
00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.890 
supposed to be doing and instead of
responding to what God said you want to

153
00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.470 
have a prayer meeting you want to pray
and fast about those things that God has

154
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:05.130 
already made clear well in that case
you're praying and you're fasting is

155
00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:11.410 
working against God's will because those
who love God when you hear God speak you

156
00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:16.850 
respond according to the word immediately
I wonder if there's anybody in the

157
00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.010 
building that's clear about what God has
told you to do.

158
00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.270 
And you've been asking for prayer.

159
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.570 
Stop praying and start moving.

160
00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:33.190 
The Bible says that Paul and Silas are on
their way to this spot.

161
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.990 
The Holy Spirit stops them, reroutes them.

162
00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.430 
And you wonder sometimes, why am I being rerouted?

163
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:47.050 
Well, in Acts 16, verse 16, it tells us,
it says, now it happened as we went to

164
00:20:47.060 --> 00:21:04.090 
prayer The reason why God rerouted where
they were going is because God had for

165
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.890 
them a divine appointment, a little girl,
a young girl that they needed to meet and

166
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.550 
a girl that needed to meet them.

167
00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.010 
The Bible tells us some things about that girl.

168
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.910 
Can we look at the Bible real quick and
find out what the bible says about this

169
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:23.390 
girl first of all the bible tells us that
the girl was young so at a time when

170
00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:27.490 
she's supposed to be playing in the
streets when she's supposed to be playing

171
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:33.550 
with dolls when she should have been at a
playground swinging in a swing when she

172
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:40.850 
should have been eating lollipops when
she should have been eating popsicles

173
00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:46.990 
enjoying the summer going on summer trips
to Disney The Bible tells us that it's a

174
00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.410 
young girl And the girl is a slave Now in
the Bible People became slaves only in

175
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:57.750 
three ways That I know about But again I
told you I'm not that smart So maybe

176
00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.710 
there are more But we're going to
concentrate on the three First of all

177
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:06.010 
there are some people who were sold into
slavery Because of their parents Their

178
00:22:06.020 --> 00:22:11.430 
parents owed some creditors So much money
And their parents were cowards So rather

179
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.850 
than their parents Selling themselves
into slavery They will sell their

180
00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:20.910 
children and their grandchildren into
slavery Not because of what the children

181
00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.990 
did But because of what the parents did I
know there's some parents in the house

182
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.590 
And if there's no parents in the house
There's future parents in the house Don't

183
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.670 
sell your children into slavery Because
of some addiction that you're suffering

184
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:40.230 
with Generational curses All over our
families Because of what our parents did

185
00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:48.010 
Some people are sold into slavery Then
other people are captured You know, the

186
00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:51.810 
country goes at war And they find all the
young people Kind of like Daniel,

187
00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:55.390 
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego Some
people are captured But then some people

188
00:22:55.400 --> 00:23:03.410 
are born into slavery Where slavery is
all they know Slavery is all they've ever

189
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:10.730 
seen Ghettos is all they know Poverty is
all they've ever seen That's all they

190
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:16.530 
know They don't know anything else When I
was in Seattle, Washington, I was dealing

191
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:21.070 
with a group of people, a group of young
people, and some of them, listen, some of

192
00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.010 
them had never seen the airport.

193
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:27.940 
Far less getting on a plane.

194
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:39.020 
Some people where slavery and poverty and
hurt and pain is all they know.

195
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:46.940 
Now it becomes very difficult When people
who have been living In glass houses In

196
00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:54.360 
suburbs with buses That actually work and
come on time When those people Decide and

197
00:23:54.370 --> 00:24:00.820 
judge People who have been born Into
slavery and poverty And that's all they

198
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:08.440 
know And when you say Pull up yourself by
your bootstraps If you just work a little

199
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.100 
bit hard It will be okay.

200
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:11.320 
Really?

201
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.040 
So when you come to school or when you
show up, do you ever have to, have you

202
00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:20.120 
ever had to go to school and not have breakfast?

203
00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.520 
Have you ever experienced that?

204
00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:26.460 
So then how am I and you being judged on
the same plane when we're not standing on

205
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:30.260 
the same plane at all because you came to
school with your stomach full and I

206
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:34.660 
couldn't concentrate on that math class
because my stomach hurt me so bad that my

207
00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:38.080 
brain was just fried because I hadn't
eaten in two days.

208
00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:42.020 
Some people have been born.

209
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:46.280 
This young girl, she was born.

210
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.120 
She was a slave.

211
00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:51.500 
And that's all she knew.

212
00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.980 
But the Bible doesn't only tell us that
she was young.

213
00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.460 
The Bible doesn't only tell us that she
was a slave.

214
00:24:57.690 --> 00:25:00.100 
Then the Bible tells us something, and
this thing is so deep.

215
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.840 
And when the Bible gets deep, I just go,
it's just amazing.

216
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:05.280 
It just blows my mind.

217
00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.840 
Because the Bible is just so crazy that

218
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:10.480 
when you start to dig in, you can't help
but get excited.

219
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.480 
The Bible says that she was also involved.

220
00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.420 
She had a spirit of divination.

221
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.120 
Can someone say divination?

222
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.020 
Spirit of divination.

223
00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:25.100 
So when I saw that, Mike, I started to
dig and I started to ask, what is this

224
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:26.100 
spirit of divination?

225
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:28.660 
And as I started to dig, the actual Greek

226
00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:31.380 
said that she had the spirit of python.

227
00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:34.680 
Well, what's the spirit of python?

228
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:40.340 
The spirit of python, there was this
Greek god, Apollos, and outside of his

229
00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.940 
big temple somewhere in Europe he would
have all of these soothsayers all of

230
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:49.440 
these people fortune tellers like Miss
Cleo what was her name?

231
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:58.710 
Miss Cleo and these people would tell the
future and all these people would come to

232
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.250 
the temple to try to find out what their
future would be but it was so agonizing

233
00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:08.250 
for them to tell the future because their
bodies would just convulge and their

234
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:13.370 
bodies would be wracked in pain And they
would call this spirit the ability to

235
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.730 
prophesy or the ability to foretell the future.

236
00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.250 
They call it the spirit of Python.

237
00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:27.310 
Because of the pain that the people had
to go through in order to foretell the future.

238
00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:28.530 
Python.

239
00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.790 
Python is a snake.

240
00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:32.330 
Isn't it?

241
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.490 
So then I start to go to the zoo and ask

242
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.630 
questions about the snake.

243
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.550 
Because if she had the spirit of python I

244
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:45.350 
want to find out about the snake And I
found out that snakes kill by two ways

245
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:53.370 
Snakes kill by venom Venom is something
that comes inside of you Where you're

246
00:26:53.380 --> 00:27:01.450 
being killed from the inside out But a
python is not a venomous snake A python

247
00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:10.790 
is a constrictor A python kills by
applying pressure on the outside and

248
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.810 
squeezing its prey until its prey has
nothing left.

249
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:21.110 
It literally squeezes the life out of its
prey from the outside.

250
00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:28.790 
There's some people who are dying in our
communities and they're dying because of

251
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.310 
stuff that happened on the inside.

252
00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.250 
Some people are dying because of stuff

253
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.090 
that their parents did.

254
00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.190 
Some people are dying because of stuff

255
00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.270 
That they did to themselves But there's
some people in our communities That are

256
00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:43.990 
being squeezed to death And they're being
squeezed to death From the outside

257
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:53.370 
Squeezed to death So that when you go to
a poor community And you see more liquor

258
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.930 
stores Than libraries Ah!

259
00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:04.940 
Spirit of Python When you can go to

260
00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:11.120 
McDonald's And that's the only meal That
you can afford But in California, when

261
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.980 
you pull up to the drive -thru window,
you see a label on the drive -thru window

262
00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:19.880 
that says this food is known to cause cancer.

263
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.140 
And that's all you can feed your children.

264
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.270 
Squeezing from the outside.

265
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:35.150 
The spirit of python is all around us.

266
00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:42.750 
when you go to cities that used to be
filled with minorities and now all of a

267
00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:48.130 
sudden in a neighborhood where minorities
used to thrive they can no longer get

268
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:54.850 
bank loans to fix their broken houses and
then all of a sudden in five years you go

269
00:28:54.860 --> 00:28:59.070 
back to that neighborhood and the
neighborhood is all fixed up all the

270
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.630 
grass is green all the palm trees are
swaying and all of a sudden the bank's

271
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:18.560 
got money to loan from the outside spirit
of python is squeezing us squeezing us

272
00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:23.400 
and it intends to squeeze us until
there's nothing left now this is the

273
00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:32.500 
problem with constricting snakes because
sometimes the prey struggles and looks

274
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:48.780 
alive but it's really struggling to its
death cause spirit of python so you got a

275
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:55.880 
young girl who should have been playing
she's a slave she's a slave and she also

276
00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.020 
has a spirit and the bible says that the
spirit is the spirit of python and then

277
00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.500 
the bible says this can I make it a
little bit worse are you guys still with

278
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:07.840 
me this evening I'm going to make it a
little bit worse it says that she has

279
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:16.220 
these people she's a slave to these men
and the bible calls the men lords and

280
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:26.920 
these men are making money on her misery
and they're profiting from her pain I

281
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:31.980 
can't tell you the name of the guy but
just this week there was a guy who he's

282
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.720 
one of these very rich men that went out
and bought a pharmaceutical company and a

283
00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:40.900 
pharmaceutical company makes a drug that
is very specific that people who are

284
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:48.320 
hurting really really need He takes the
drug and he jacks up the price by over 100%.

285
00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:57.860 
He gets called in to Congress and they're
asking him why this drug has miraculously

286
00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.540 
gone up by over 100%.

287
00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:05.440 
And he pleads the fifth And smiles all

288
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:20.360 
the way through Spirit of python Lords
making money off of misery And profiting

289
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:32.960 
off of pain Paul and Silas see this girl
It gets deeper Paul and Silas see this

290
00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:40.260 
girl And when they see this girl They are
aware Someone say aware They're aware of

291
00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:45.540 
her plight They're aware that she's a
slave They're aware that there's a spirit

292
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:54.520 
on her And they do nothing about it Acts
16 verse 18 I want you to stay with me

293
00:31:54.530 --> 00:32:01.260 
And she did this for many days She walked
around behind Paul and Silas And said

294
00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:06.600 
these men are men of God These men are
men of God She did it over and over and

295
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:11.880 
over and over For many days And Paul did nothing.

296
00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:17.080 
And I was so disappointed and hurt to

297
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:20.880 
know that Paul, my hero, saw a young girl.

298
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.860 
And he was aware of her issue.

299
00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:25.220 
And he was aware of her pain.

300
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:27.340 
And he was aware that she was a slave.

301
00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:30.140 
And he was aware that she had this spirit
on her.

302
00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:33.080 
The spirit of python squeezing the life
out of her.

303
00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:35.400 
And he did nothing.

304
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.280 
He did nothing.

305
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:45.180 
He did nothing He did nothing He had the
power in him To change her life And he

306
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:52.580 
did nothing He ignored What this little
girl was going through How do you ignore

307
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:58.360 
The pain of the people around you When
you got power to change it Nothing

308
00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:25.660 
Nothing So a little boy in Cleveland
Playing with a toy gun And he shot back

309
00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:48.010 
He dies o a kid catching a train in
Portland, Oregon arrested by cops in

310
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:57.490 
handcuffs and gets shot multiple times
and dies on the train platform and we do

311
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:06.570 
nothing listen it's not new one of the
churches that were grimly absent and

312
00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:18.920 
silent during the times when black people
needed to hear their voice we're used to

313
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:19.840 
doing nothing.

314
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:24.240 
Nothing.

315
00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:25.580 
Nothing.

316
00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:26.900 
We do nothing.

317
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:28.640 
A little girl is dying.

318
00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:29.980 
We do nothing.

319
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.780 
Diabetes in our communities.

320
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:33.960 
We do nothing.

321
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:36.680 
Kids get shot all over the place.

322
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.420 
All you're worried about is your bill.

323
00:34:38.610 --> 00:34:39.460 
We do nothing.

324
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.640 
We could still come to choir practice And

325
00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:48.820 
sing la la la songs While we do nothing
How is it that people are going through

326
00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:57.830 
pain And the church of God is doing
nothing Nothing We're aware of the issue

327
00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:08.330 
We're aware of the problem But we do
nothing The problem is That when we hear

328
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:14.630 
about issues Not just with black people
You watch CNN You watch CNN and after

329
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.490 
those jokers Who are trying to be
president Finish all their parading

330
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:25.490 
There's people in Syria That can't eat
There's a little mother Listen, when you

331
00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:30.370 
look at TV I want you to stop making some
mockery Of these people in these

332
00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:34.410 
countries I want you to be able to look
at them And when you see a little kid

333
00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:38.950 
With a swell stomach Because they have
not eaten And you're in the calf throwing

334
00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:43.710 
things away I want you to see that that
kid is not a puppet That kid is not a

335
00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:49.090 
play doll That kid is a real child from a
real mother Who had dreams for his life

336
00:35:50.060 --> 00:36:09.460 
And we Do The worst thing in the world Is
when people Who could do something Do

337
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:20.140 
Nothing Because according to the bible
that I read The person That caused the

338
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:29.210 
pain The lords, the pimps Is no more evil
than the person who does nothing about it

339
00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:41.400 
Paul does nothing he doesn't even turn
around doesn't rub her head he does

340
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:54.040 
nothing until is there anybody in the
house that has failed God so many times

341
00:36:54.050 --> 00:36:58.080 
you failed him over and over again but
you're thankful that God gave you another

342
00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:05.860 
opportunity to do something when you did
nothing how many people are grateful for

343
00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:19.930 
a second chance he did nothing until
thank you jesus he did nothing until this

344
00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:27.730 
is what the bible says in act 16 18 he
says and this she did for many days but

345
00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:40.430 
paul became annoyed he became annoyed see
when I watch CNN I'm amused and if I see

346
00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:46.070 
things long enough I might become
agitated when I become amused I'll tell

347
00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.990 
my wife did you see such and such on
Facebook that ain't right girl that ain't

348
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.170 
right alright what we got for dinner
what's for dinner that's what we need to

349
00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:02.390 
talk about when I become agitated I might
make a post on Facebook I might send a

350
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.090 
letter to somebody But after I make the
post And after I send the letter I walk

351
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:11.510 
away because I've done my civil duty And
I can allow them to continue to be in

352
00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.810 
pain Because if I ever saw them in heaven
I would be able to say I made a post

353
00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:30.680 
about your problem It's not amused
anymore Paul Is not agitated anymore No,

354
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:38.440 
the Bible says That Paul is annoyed The
word actually means that he's angry And

355
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:44.220 
it means that he's angry to the point
That he's willing to actually do

356
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:57.980 
something about it Paul is annoyed I'm
waiting for a generation of young people

357
00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:09.720 
In the Seventh -day Adventist church To
get past simply being amused Did you see

358
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:10.300 
what happened?

359
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.880 
Snapchat!

360
00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:19.730 
No, no, I'm waiting for us to get past
being agitated.

361
00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:25.730 
Because when we're agitated, forgive me,
you know, I try to be nice and my wife

362
00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.690 
says, you preach like you don't want to
come back.

363
00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.390 
That's the only way I know how to preach.

364
00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:36.530 
I got a church in Sacramento, all right?

365
00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:45.390 
Listen, listen, listen, I am waiting for
a bunch of young people to say that we're

366
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:52.010 
not amused and we're not just agitated
because when we're agitated there's an

367
00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:58.830 
issue in the world, we speak to that
issue for as long as it is convenient and

368
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:08.970 
then the issue remains and we get silent
so I saw in March, it was nice saw a

369
00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:16.890 
video of it it was really cool I was
proud of my alma mater for responding But

370
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:26.730 
what happened next I've seen the posters
Water for Flint It's great And I'm sure

371
00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.870 
that it can use your water But when your
water runs out And they're still drinking

372
00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.800 
brown water What are you going to do
about it I see the buses We go to Benton

373
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:44.550 
Harbor We wave as we pass by But when
there's no change in the poverty in

374
00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:55.740 
Benton Harbor But we still got money to
be able to buy multiple Jordans am I

375
00:40:55.750 --> 00:41:02.720 
messing up maybe I'm messing up hey
listen it ain't just you I ain't just

376
00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:08.360 
talking to you I'm talking to me see when
I do the evangelistic meeting I want to

377
00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.100 
see everybody in the house the house
needs to be full and then we're going to

378
00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:14.920 
baptize we're going to dunk them we're
going to celebrate them we're going to

379
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:19.040 
have a meal we're going to shake their
hands at the door but when they go home

380
00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:23.900 
and they go back to their houses and the
evangelistic event is done I no longer

381
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:27.880 
have anything to report because everybody
has hailed me as the greatest evangelist

382
00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:32.480 
that ever lived because I baptized 50
when these 50 people who were baptized

383
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:41.450 
actually need real help am I going to
show up am I going to be around or am I

384
00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:50.430 
going to do what Paul did and ignore it
he ignored it until the Bible says that

385
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.150 
he became agitated y angry y annoyed ¿sí
lo que estoy tratando de esta mañana?

386
00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.190 
no sé si estoy tratando de un buen
trabajo de esto estoy tratando de hacer

387
00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:06.820 
mal pero no quiero hacer mal at la
escuela no quiero hacer mal at la system

388
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:12.240 
no quiero hacer mal at Fox o CNN no
quiero hacer mal at politicians quiero

389
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:18.960 
hacer mal at you porque el poder de Dios
es en el mundo para cambiar el mundo y

390
00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:24.960 
usando Dios el poder que te dio para
cambiar el mundo to make your pockets fat.

391
00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:30.790 
Use me.

392
00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.150 
Anybody in the building want to say, God,

393
00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:34.830 
use me.

394
00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:42.420 
Paul gets agitated.

395
00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:46.420 
And when he gets agitated, he turns around.

396
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.820 
And he doesn't have to ask God for power

397
00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:52.000 
because the power to change that girl was
always in him.

398
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:55.680 
He turns around and he just says this.

399
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:58.940 
He said to the spirit, now I told you

400
00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:03.500 
that the Bible is deep and it's real real
wonderful I want you to read this text

401
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:08.020 
tonight and I want you to celebrate with
me because Paul didn't speak to the girl

402
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:16.880 
he spoke to the spirit speak to her Paul
didn't speak to the girl Paul didn't say

403
00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:21.800 
you dirty nothing nothing you are a
prostitute you are a drug dealer your

404
00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:27.840 
skirt is too low no he didn't speak to
any of that he spoke to the spirit

405
00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:33.060 
because the issue was never the girl God
loved the girl It was the spirit in the

406
00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:39.640 
girl That had to come out of the girl
Paul spoke to the spirit Stop vilifying

407
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:44.840 
people There's only one villain in the
world And that villain is a dirty dirty

408
00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:50.360 
dog And his name is the devil And
sometimes we're casting on people Things

409
00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:59.420 
that we should be throwing to him Paul
didn't have no problem with the girl He

410
00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:07.980 
had a problem with the spirit in the girl
So then Paul says this I command you Now

411
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:14.480 
When you just Yeah You just speak to
something If I go home and tell my wife I

412
00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:48.180 
command you Use the word Are people Who
understand that they have Authority You

413
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:59.960 
People who use the word Command
Understand That they have Authority Now,

414
00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:09.670 
I walk around and I call myself the king
of my house When I'm not in the house But

415
00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:16.830 
when I get into my house This is what
happens Damien, take out the garbage Yes

416
00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:28.910 
ma 'am I saw on the kids report card that
they were late on Monday I'm so sorry

417
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:38.570 
Jesus Save us Because in my house I hope
my wife is not looking Watching on ¿Is

418
00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.010 
this online?

419
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:49.100 
New Jesus You ready?

420
00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:55.480 
Because There's some people who act like
they have power And it's only when you

421
00:45:55.490 --> 00:46:00.500 
get into a situation where power is
needed That we can see how powerless you

422
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:05.840 
really are You really know who got the
power when you get into the situation We

423
00:46:05.850 --> 00:46:10.620 
talked about being underpowered yesterday
We're jumping off of that today When I

424
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:18.100 
walk into the house When my wife speaks I
move Porque mi wife has authority Paul

425
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:24.200 
says I command you We've been playing
with the devil for too long We've been

426
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:28.040 
allowing things to exist In our
communities that God has already Given us

427
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:34.120 
authority over If we would just say to
the devil I command you We've been seeing

428
00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:38.800 
things in our families Generational
curses And things that don't need to be

429
00:46:38.810 --> 00:46:43.800 
there God wanted to deliver you a long
time ago But you gotta use your authority

430
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:55.740 
my children will love the Lord my house
shall be saved my church shall be full in

431
00:46:55.750 --> 00:47:00.680 
the name of Jesus we will take sacramento
for the king because God has given me

432
00:47:00.690 --> 00:47:05.340 
authority I command you I wonder if
there's anybody in the house that's

433
00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:16.290 
willing to use the authority you say
command the devil knows that you're not

434
00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:25.210 
playing games so stop these pity patty
prayers Lord I pray that you would use

435
00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:35.450 
the drugs to touch the doctors let them
work their work and maybe just maybe I

436
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:39.770 
might be healed of this cold what?

437
00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:51.780 
somebody shout out we got authority he

438
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:58.860 
turns and he uses the power that was
always in him to do what he should have

439
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:08.490 
already done turned and he says I command
you and then you know when you got

440
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:19.720 
authority when you got authority the
question ends up being who did that

441
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:34.490 
authority come from can I go back to my
house every once in a while my daughter

442
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:42.800 
and sons try to play me Cliff you know
them well they try to play me I don't

443
00:48:42.810 --> 00:48:52.200 
like getting played they will come up to
me y les diré, «Daddy, we don't got to do

444
00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:53.100 
no homework today».

445
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:56.020 
Now, when they tell me that they don't

446
00:48:56.030 --> 00:49:05.010 
have to do homework, I am tempted to take
my right hand and to connect it with

447
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:13.040 
their left butt cheek because you can't
tell me that you ain't doing no homework.

448
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:16.740 
I'm the boss.

449
00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:32.300 
Until they say, Mommy said When they say

450
00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:45.820 
Mommy said Daddy says Well okay then
Because mommy got authority See Zoe and

451
00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:52.620 
Salem And Levi they ain't got no
authority One is ten One is six And one

452
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:58.680 
is four going forward You ain't got no
authority Yeah yeah But when they invoke

453
00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:10.150 
mommy's name We're about to go to work,
we're about to go to work The Bible says

454
00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.310 
in the book of Matthew That there's a
strong man that holds a house That's what

455
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:19.730 
the Bible says It describes evil spirits
like a strong man That holds a house And

456
00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:25.650 
this is what the Bible says That until a
stronger man Comes into the house And

457
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:31.370 
binds that strong man There's no way to
take that strong man's property One more

458
00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:37.210 
time The Bible says that evil spirits Are
like a strong man that has a house It

459
00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:44.390 
takes a stronger man To come in and bind
that man And then take his property I

460
00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:53.380 
don't fight against the devil To him I
look weak To him I look porgy To him I

461
00:50:53.390 --> 00:51:01.210 
look like a four year old boy Trying to
be forty But when I invoke Brother Jesus

462
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:09.950 
Christ Jesus is the stronger man y
snatches his property.

463
00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.440 
Jesus Christ is the strong man.

464
00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:28.670 
When I invoke Jesus' name, when I call on

465
00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:42.790 
the name of Yeshua, do you know that when
I call on the name of Yeshua, do you know

466
00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.730 
why it makes the devil afraid?

467
00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.070 
This is where you got to dig in the word.

468
00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:56.710 
You know why the name of Jesus makes the
devil afraid it's in the meaning of his

469
00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:07.580 
name can anybody in the house tell me
what Jesus name means what salvation

470
00:52:09.390 --> 00:52:27.730 
means that God saves it's in his name
it's in his name so that when I call on

471
00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:41.110 
his name I I pronunce to the devil The
function of my big brother My big brother

472
00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:51.890 
He saves Now notice That Jesus' name Does
not include What he is able to save from

473
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:59.950 
Because if that was included In his name
Then all the devil would need to do Is

474
00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:10.990 
find something that's not on Jesus' list
Jesus can save From the gutter most To

475
00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:25.290 
the utter most Anything you going through
He's able to deliver Jesus save That God

476
00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:33.410 
has given you To be able to command
Demons And devils To flee there's

477
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:41.910 
authority That God has placed In his
church To command poverty and sickness to

478
00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:49.210 
cease there is authority that God has
given me as a parent to pray the Holy

479
00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:54.530 
Spirit over my children while they sleep
but if I'm not willing to use the

480
00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:01.130 
authority that God has already given me
if I want to ignore the issues then the

481
00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:07.610 
issues that I ignore will stay the same
because people who have power do nothing

482
00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:18.470 
to help the powerless I'm done They call
on the name of Jesus When they call on

483
00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:27.050 
the name of Jesus This is what the Bible
says He says in the name of Jesus Come

484
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:42.060 
out of her And he came out And went away
That very hour Listen This is not a come

485
00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:50.920 
to Jesus Sermon This is a wake up and do
God's work sermon I appreciate All of the

486
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:55.720 
universities We got I appreciate all the
hospitals we got I appreciate all the

487
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:59.480 
churches we got But when you got
universities and hospitals And churches

488
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:04.180 
that exist in communities And those
communities are still Lost and those

489
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:08.420 
communities are still Suffering though
those churches And communities and

490
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.880 
hospitals have Been there for a hundred
years then something is wrong with the

491
00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:18.780 
church can you agree with me on that when
you got a school that graduates 400

492
00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:24.180 
graduates that leave this place every
single year and you go all over the world

493
00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.740 
you go to here you go to there and the
places that you go to are still lost then

494
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:32.520 
something's wrong something's wrong
something's wrong and I want to suggest

495
00:55:32.530 --> 00:55:39.160 
to you tonight the issue is one of the
issues are is You have ignored what you

496
00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:39.940 
are aware of.

497
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:45.080 
But after you become aware, I want you to

498
00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:45.800 
become angry.

499
00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:49.080 
And then after you become angry, I want

500
00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:49.940 
you to be the answer.

501
00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:52.160 
I want you to become aware.

502
00:55:52.590 --> 00:55:54.160 
I want you to become angry.

503
00:55:54.590 --> 00:55:57.460 
Then I want you to be the answer.

504
00:55:58.810 --> 00:55:59.880 
There's this lady.

505
00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:04.020 
I just learned about her just today.

506
00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:09.340 
This lady's name was Josephine.

507
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:13.240 
She lived in the city of Montgomery.

508
00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:18.880 
And near 1939, she was sitting on a bus.

509
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:22.000 
And when she was sitting on that bus, she

510
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:25.380 
watched a black woman walk into the bus
and pay her fare.

511
00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:30.600 
In those days, when you paid your fare as
a black person, you'd walk in the front

512
00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:31.920 
door, pay your fare.

513
00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:34.200 
Then you would have to get off the bus

514
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:38.360 
and walk into the black door and sit in
the back.

515
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:45.260 
She sat, she watched this black lady get
in and pay her fare and when the black

516
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:48.840 
lady got off the bus the bus driver
pulled off.

517
00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.130 
Now I got to tell you a little bit about Josephine.

518
00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:54.570 
Can I tell you a little bit about Josephine?

519
00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.070 
She was a white lady.

520
00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.770 
She was an aristocrat.

521
00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:02.070 
She was rich.

522
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:08.970 
She had a name and she had power but a

523
00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:19.050 
long time before Rosa Parks this white
lady Josephine used her power to help the

524
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:28.310 
powerless she got up said that she was
angry and she pulled the emergency stop

525
00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:38.850 
on the bus and made the driver stop Until
that black lady got on That's how you use

526
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:48.040 
power The article said for days after
that Every time Josephine was on a bus

527
00:57:48.050 --> 00:57:57.140 
She would pull the emergency stop To make
sure that black people Could get on

528
00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:04.840 
Because she had power And she had
authority and she used it for people who

529
00:58:04.850 --> 00:58:14.120 
did not have power or authority my little
son Salem he was in my wife's car and my

530
00:58:14.130 --> 00:58:21.580 
son is very sensitive to pain and he was
driving down the street and he saw a

531
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:30.200 
homeless man standing at the street light
listen to this the homeless man that he

532
00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:37.880 
saw I've seen a million times before and
I know that though that man may be

533
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:46.160 
homeless he's playing some folk and
making a lot of money my son so when I

534
00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:53.680 
see that homeless man I often say you
don't need no money in my head you're

535
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:59.960 
just trying to play me for the money I
work hard for but not my son my son saw

536
00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:08.300 
the homeless man and he started to weep
and he cried uncontrollably all the way

537
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:14.960 
to church he cried through a piece of the
church service and no one could console

538
00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:24.100 
him and then he said why is it that
people can purchase a ticket and win 1 .5

539
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:39.910 
billion dollars and that man is hungry
he's six I trust God that when he becomes

540
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:51.410 
a man of authority He will use His power
To help the powerless You're here at

541
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:55.830 
Andrews University You're going to leave
as doctors and lawyers And engineers,

542
00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:01.070 
biochemists You're going to be pastors
You're going to be successful You're

543
01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:04.170 
going to have your degrees You're going
to leave Andrews University You're going

544
01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:07.490 
to do your masters And you're going to do
your doctorate And you're going to pray,

545
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.810 
God give me opportunity But God is
questioning your request tonight because

546
01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:17.150 
he's asking, what are you going to do
with the power you're asking for?

547
01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:21.320 
Is it going to just make your pocket fat?

548
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:25.080 
Are you going to turn around to a slave

549
01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:31.220 
girl who should have been licking a
lollipop and enjoying a summer at Disney

550
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:36.740 
and use your power to help the powerless?

551
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:40.040 
I wonder if there's anyone in the

552
01:00:40.050 --> 01:00:46.920 
building today That would say to God God
you can use me You can trust me Reroute

553
01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:53.720 
my life And place me in a place oh God
Where I can use the power that you've

554
01:00:53.730 --> 01:01:00.660 
given me To help people who need it If
you're in this building And you're

555
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:05.800 
serious about that commitment Only for
those who are serious about it Will you

556
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:14.300 
stand and join me at the altar Because I
want God to use My power To help the

557
01:01:14.310 --> 01:01:23.480 
powerless I want God to use My influence
For the benefit of someone else I want

558
01:01:23.490 --> 01:01:39.850 
God To reroute my life Change my course
Use me To set some slave free Come in

559
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:51.350 
close I'm going to give you a caveat You
ready for the caveat?

560
01:01:51.800 --> 01:02:00.220 
The work that you're asking God to do
through you Cannot be added to your plans

561
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:09.420 
for yourself So in coming to this altar
You are saying to God God, no longer my

562
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:16.600 
plans You have a divine appointment for
me I want to be where you want me to be I

563
01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:22.260 
want to do what you call me to do And I'm
willing to give my plans away I give

564
01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:29.150 
myself away You gotta ask yourself
whether or not you're ready to do this

565
01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:43.500 
All your plans and dreams I give myself
away So you, so you can use me I give

566
01:02:43.510 --> 01:03:02.740 
myself away So you ready?

567
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:06.520 
So now, I believe the Bible is full of

568
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:15.840 
symbolism y actual actions symbols cause
truths to seek into my heart I want you

569
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:21.680 
right now to go into your pocket if you
have one or pretend you do and I want you

570
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:28.520 
to pull out your plan for your life your
plan go in there and pull out your plan

571
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:36.460 
your plan then I want you to put your
plan in the middle of your two hands and

572
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:43.740 
present it to God as an altar Say God you
can have it Sacrifice it It does not

573
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:51.220 
belong to me anymore I'm giving it You
got your plan in your hands Now I want

574
01:03:51.230 --> 01:04:00.680 
you to look at your plan I want you to
tell your plan Goodbye For some of you it

575
01:04:00.690 --> 01:04:05.340 
means that Something that you've been
chasing after your entire life Telling it

576
01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:12.320 
goodbye Some dream Hey listen the dreams
of your parents who are paying your

577
01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:17.760 
school bill God is going to call some of
you tonight to be bold and to really

578
01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:23.340 
share with your parents what God has
always been saying to you you're not

579
01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:27.880 
supposed to be in that major you're not
supposed to study that stuff and you

580
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:35.120 
can't live your life to make your parents
proud and make God sad no matter who's

581
01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:40.280 
paying the bill because God says I got a
cattle on a thousand hills I got a

582
01:04:40.290 --> 01:04:45.160 
million ways to pay your bill If you
would just give it to me So I want you to

583
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:50.620 
raise That altar high Raise that altar
high Let God know he can have it Repeat

584
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:58.540 
after me Lord you can have it Lord you
can have it My life is not my own I

585
01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:05.460 
belong to you Use me for your cause Come

586
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:14.680

your cause Father, I pray That you will

587
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:20.560 
absolutely jack up somebody's life And
that you would start tonight Father, I

588
01:05:20.570 --> 01:05:26.920 
pray that you will reroute someone's life
And that you will start tonight God, I

589
01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:33.980 
pray in the mighty name of Jesus That you
will allow your spirit to rest so heavy

590
01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:41.400 
on someone's heart tonight that they will
not be able to sleep until they change

591
01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:48.340 
until they're determined to use the
authority and the power that you've given

592
01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:58.160 
to them to help the powerless to lift
some slave girl out of slavery Father I

593
01:05:58.170 --> 01:06:05.460 
also pray that this won't just be a
moment but that your spirit will so

594
01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:14.600 
agitate us until we become annoyed until
we become angry at the things that you're

595
01:06:14.610 --> 01:06:21.320 
angry at until we feel the pain of the
things where you feel pain and that it

596
01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:28.320 
won't be for a moment and it won't be for
a text or a tweet or a Facebook post but

597
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:33.100 
that You will give each and every one of
us an assignment that we can't shake.

598
01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:45.770 
That we will continue for the
underprivileged to lift up and break the

599
01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:47.770 
back of slavery and poverty.

600
01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:52.240 
Make the world that we live in better

601
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.300 
because we're here.

602
01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.740 
Holy Spirit, sit on our hearts.

603
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:03.920 
And may we not be able to shake this mission.

604
01:07:04.930 --> 01:07:06.680 
In the mighty name of Jesus.

605
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:20.750 
the one who saves repeat with me ready my
life is not my own this is the conclusion
