00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.510 
Hi, hi there.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.970 
Welcome to this lesson.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.830 
For today, we're going to be checking out
some interesting phrases.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.870 
So, the first phrase is, Mary Curry was polished.

5
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:16.170 
You know this woman?

6
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.050 
She's Mary Curry.

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.450 
So, Mary Curry was, era, was, era, fue,

8
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.850

¿Por qué was?

11
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.330 
Because she's dead.

12
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.590 
Porque ella está muerta.

Ella ya no existe.

15

So, that's why we say, when somebody that

16
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.010 
has died, we want to refer to somebody
that has died, we say, was, okay?

Cuando nos queremos referir a alguien que
se murió ya y que ya no está, pues,

decimos, was, que era, okay?

19
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.650
