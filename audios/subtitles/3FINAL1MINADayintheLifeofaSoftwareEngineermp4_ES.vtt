Hi, my name is Sarah and welcome to a day
in the life of a software engineer, come

2
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.240 
on in.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.940 
So, I woke up at 5 today, I already got

4
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.680 
my workout in, I took care of my fur kids
and gave them a little love, but I

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.920 
officially can't start my workday without
a cup of coffee, so I make a cup of coffee.

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.120 
A software engineer develops software for
multiple companies.

7
00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.040 
I have been working at my company for
about 5 years, but I have been coding for

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.920 
a little over a decade .My usual schedule
is 8 to 4 and it is kind of nice to be

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.300 
able to take a break here and there to do
anything that I need to around the house

10
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.480 
or go to a store if I need to .So, the
tasks that I perform on a daily basis

11
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.800 
include updating my code if somebody
requested a change that I make, sometimes

12
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:58.560 
I spend a lot of time replying to emails
if that is necessary, I check in on my

13
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.960 
interns to see if they need any help with anything,
