1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.180 
It's a piece of cake.

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.480 
It's very easy to do.

3
00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:05.160 
Break a leg.

4
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.640 
Good luck.

5
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.820 
Hit the nail on the head.

6
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.220 
You got it exactly right.

7
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.420 
The ball is in your court.

8
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.600 
It's your decision now.

9
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.300 
Bite the bullet.

10
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.400 
Face a difficult situation bravely.

11
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.440 
Burn the midnight oil.

12
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.540 
Work late into the night.

13
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.420 
Caught between a rock and a hard place.

14
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.120 
In a difficult situation with no easy solution.

15
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.620 
Don't cry over spilled milk.

16
00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.180 
Don't waste time worrying about things

17
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.240 
that can't be changed.

18
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.560 
It's not rocket science.

19
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.240 
It's not difficult to understand.

20
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:44.520 
A blessing in disguise.

21
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.420 
Something that seems bad at first but
turns out to be good.

22
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.260 
A dime a dozen.

23
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.940 
Very common and not special.

24
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.320 
Barking up the wrong tree.

25
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.380 
Pursuing a mistaken or misguided course

26
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.960 
of action.

27
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.320 
Let the cat out of the bag.

28
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.240 
Reveal a secret.

29
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.900 
The early bird catches the worm.

30
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.740 
Those who act promptly have an advantage.

31
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.400 
Every cloud has a silver lining.

32
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.940 
There's something good in every bad situation.

33
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.680 
Put all your eggs in one basket.

34
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.460 
Risk everything on a single venture.

35
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
Go the extra mile.

36
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.660 
Make a special effort.

37
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.440 
Under the weather.

38
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.760 
Feeling ill or unwell.

39
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.180 
Take it with a grain of salt.

40
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.480 
Don't take it too seriously.

41
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.380 
On thin ice.

42
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.700 
In a risky situation.

43
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.040 
Let sleeping dogs lie.

44
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.140 
Don't disturb a situation as it is.

45
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.500 
The best of both worlds.

46
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.760 
An ideal situation.

47
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.380 
Curiosity killed the cat.

48
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.260 
Being too inquisitive can lead to trouble.

49
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.920 
Going from a bad situation to a worse one.

50
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.420 
Actions speak louder than words.

51
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.080 
What you do is more important than what

52
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.540 
you say.

53
00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.920 
Bite off more than you can chew.

54
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.060 
Take on a task that is way too big.

55
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.020 
Throw in the towel.

56
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.000 
Give up or surrender.

57
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.480 
The grass is always greener on the other side.

58
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
People tend to envy others' situations.

59
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.500 
An arm and a leg.

60
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.300 
Very expensive.

61
00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.800 
All bark and no bite.

62
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.840 
Someone who talks tough but isn't aggressive.

63
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.980 
The elephant in the room.

64
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.820 
A big issue that everyone ignores.

65
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.040 
Jump on the bandwagon.

66
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.100 
Join a popular activity or trend.

67
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.860 
Knock on wood.

68
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.620 
Say something to avoid bad luck.

69
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.060 
Let the chips fall where they may.

70
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.160 
Accept the consequences of your actions.

71
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.400 
A penny for your thoughts.

72
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.100 
You can't judge a book by its cover.

73
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.620 
Don't judge based on appearance.

74
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.380 
Hit the road.

75
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.600 
Leave or start a journey.

76
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.400 
In hot water.

77
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.960 
In trouble.

78
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.360 
To have a chip on your shoulder.

79
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.240 
Hold a grudge.

80
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.320 
The sky's the limit.

81
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.180 
There's no limit to what you can achieve.

82
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.480 
Throw caution to the wind.

83
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.260 
Take a risk.

84
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.080 
Get out of hand.

85
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.000 
Keep your chin up.

86
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:29.920 
Stay positive.

87
00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.200 
Put your best foot forward.

88
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
Make a good impression.

89
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.580 
Make a long story short.

90
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.540 
Tell something briefly.

91
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.720 
The tip of the iceberg.

92
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.680 
A small part of a much larger problem.

93
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.540 
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

94
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.980 
You can't have it both ways.

95
00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:57.420 
Make ends meet.

96
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.700 
Manage to live on a budget.

97
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.600 
Caught red -handed.

98
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.360 
Caught in the act of doing something wrong.

99
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.380 
All in the same boat.

100
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
Everyone is facing the same challenge.

101
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.200 
The straw that broke the camel's back.

102
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.700 
A minor action that causes a major reaction.

103
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.180 
A taste of your own medicine.

104
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.080 
Every rose has its thorn.

105
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.480 
Good things have their drawbacks.

106
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.020 
Put the cart before the horse.

107
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.380 
Do things in the wrong order.

108
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.220 
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

109
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.900 
Don't risk everything on one venture.

110
00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.900 
See eye to eye.

111
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.860 
Agree on something.

112
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
Speak of the devil.

113
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.820 
The person we were just talking about appeared.

114
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.380 
The pot calling the kettle black.

115
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.380 
A fish out of water.

116
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.660 
A person in an uncomfortable situation.

117
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
Cut to the chase.

118
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.420 
Get to the point.

119
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.160 
Under the radar.

120
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.380 
Not attracting attention.

121
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.200 
Out of the blue.

122
00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:13.160 
Unexpectedly.

123
00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.180 
All in a day's work.

124
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.500 
Something that is expected as part of the job.

125
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:20.520 
It takes two to tango.

126
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.480 
Both parties involved are responsible.

127
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.520 
Start a project with enthusiasm.

128
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.840 
Too good to be true.

129
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.340 
Something that seems wonderful but

130
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.320 
probably isn't.

131
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.020 
Out of your league.

132
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.200 
Beyond your capabilities.

133
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.040 
A leopard can't change its spots.

134
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.580 
People can't change their character.

135
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:45.700 
The ballpark figure.

136
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:47.940 
An estimated range.

137
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.560 
Burning the candle at both ends.

138
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.140 
Working too hard without rest.

139
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.100 
Betray someone for your benefit.

140
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.980 
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.

141
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.160 
Don't assume success before it happens.

142
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:06.420 
Hitting the nail on the head.

143
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.880 
Describing exactly what is causing a situation.

144
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.140 
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.

145
00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.960 
Be wary of those who may do you harm.

146
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.020 
The whole nine yards.

147
00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.420 
Everything, all the way.

148
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.480 
Get your act together.

149
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.480 
Organize yourself.

150
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.360 
Know the ropes.

151
00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.760 
Understand how things work.

152
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.120 
Barking up the wrong tree.

153
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.940 
Pursuing a mistaken course of action.

154
00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:35.980 
Sitting on the fence.

155
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.220 
Not making a decision.

156
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.400 
Fell through the cracks.

157
00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:42.760 
Something that was overlooked.

158
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.220 
It's not the end of the world.

159
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.040 
Don't worry, it's not that serious.

160
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.100 
It's all in your head.

161
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:52.400 
The problem is psychological.

162
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:54.860 
A hard nut to crack.

163
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.900 
A difficult problem.

164
00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.640 
Jump the gun.

165
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.700 
Act prematurely.

166
00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:02.660 
On the same wavelength.

167
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.140 
Have a similar understanding.

168
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:07.500 
Cry over spilled milk.

169
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.600 
Worry about something that cannot be changed.

170
00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:13.180 
A stitch in time saves nine.

171
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
Fix a small problem before it becomes a

172
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.760 
big one.

173
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:18.840 
The writing's on the wall.

174
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.320 
There are signs of trouble ahead.

175
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.940 
Cut corners.

176
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.640 
Do something in the easiest way.

177
00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:28.000 
Reining cats and dogs.

178
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.860 
Reining heavily.

179
00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.400 
Get a taste of your own medicine.

180
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.640 
Experience the same treatment you give others.

181
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:38.420 
Between a rock and a hard place.

182
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:41.060 
Facing two difficult choices.

183
00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.140 
On cloud nine.

184
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.220 
Extremely happy.

185
00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.020 
The whole shebang.

186
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.640 
The entire situation or collection of things.

187
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.900 
Take credit for someone else's achievements.

188
00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.360 
Get down to brass tacks.

189
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.540 
Focus on the essentials.

190
00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.780 
A flash in the pan.

191
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.820 
A one -time success that doesn't last.

192
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:07.660 
Burn the bridges.

193
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.600 
Eliminate the possibility of returning.

194
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.640 
Jumping for joy.

195
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.680 
Extremely happy.

196
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.700 
At the end of the day.

197
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.120 
Ultimately.

198
00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.960 
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

199
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.220 
Get the ball rolling.

200
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:27.100 
Start something.

201
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:29.720 
Put your money where your mouth is.

202
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.200 
Support your words with action.

203
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:34.980 
A penny saved is a penny earned.

204
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.320 
Saving money is as important as earning it.

205
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:41.080 
A rolling stone gathers no moss.

206
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:45.800 
A person who doesn't settle down won't
accumulate wealth or responsibilities.

207
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.740 
Betrayed by someone trusted.

208
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.660 
Like finding a needle in a haystack.

209
00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:01.560 
Extremely difficult to find something.

210
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.860 
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

211
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:07.500 
Someone who pretends to be harmless but
is dangerous.

212
00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:09.900 
The calm before the storm.

213
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:12.720 
A quiet period before chaos.

214
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.520 
What's the matter?

215
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.740 
I didn't see that coming.

216
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:18.440 
That's on me.

217
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:20.400 
We'll figure it out.

218
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.700 
I can't believe it.

219
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:26.380 
What do you think?

220
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:28.540 
Let me get back to you.

221
00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:30.640 
I'm not sure about that.

222
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.680 
It sounds like a plan.

223
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.300 
Are you okay?

224
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.720 
I need some time to think.

225
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.600 
That's a good point.

226
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.640 
Don't worry about it.

227
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.620 
It's not a big deal.

228
00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:45.020 
I'm really busy right now.

229
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.020 
Can you give me a hand?

230
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.180 
I'm sorry to hear that.

231
00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:50.980 
What are you up to?

232
00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.980 
How was your day?

233
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.100 
It's been a long time.

234
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:59.020 
I'll take care of it.

235
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.860 
Could you repeat that?

236
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:02.580 
That's interesting.

237
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:04.680 
What happened next?

238
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:07.040 
I'm looking forward to it.

239
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.420 
I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

240
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:11.400 
Can you believe that?

241
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:13.300 
Let's get started.

242
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.240 
It's time to go.

243
00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.100 
I'm here for you.

244
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.080 
Let's catch up soon.

245
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:20.940 
I'll see you later.

246
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.340 
I'm really tired today.

247
00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.240 
I don't understand.

248
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.700 
Just a moment, please.

249
00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:31.600 
What are your plans?

250
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:33.820 
I'm just trying to help.

251
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.780 
Can you keep a secret?

252
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.960 
I've had a long day.

253
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.060 
Do you want to grab a bite?

254
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.460 
I didn't mean to offend you.

255
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.500 
Let's stay in touch.

256
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.820 
It's not what it looks like.

257
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:48.840 
I'll find out for you.

258
00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.560 
It's all good.

259
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.420 
That makes sense.

260
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:54.660 
I'm really proud of you.

261
00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.580 
Can I borrow this?

262
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.720 
That's the way it goes.

263
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.980 
I can't wait to see you.

264
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:02.900 
I need your advice.

265
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:05.140 
How do you feel about that?

266
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.220 
I'll figure it out later.

267
00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.400 
What's your favorite movie?

268
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.640 
It's a little complicated.

269
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:13.720 
I didn't know that.

270
00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:15.860 
It's better late than never.

271
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:18.100 
I didn't think about that.

272
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.140 
That sounds good to me.

273
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:21.980 
Can you believe it?

274
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:23.900 
I think we should go.

275
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.220 
I hope you have a great day.

276
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.200 
Let's take a break.

277
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.540 
It's a win -win situation.

278
00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:33.080 
I'm excited for the weekend.

279
00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:35.160 
What are you working on?

280
00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:36.980 
I need a favor.

281
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:39.340 
Let's not jump to conclusions.

282
00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:41.640 
I'm not feeling well.

283
00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:43.580 
What brings you here?

284
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.460 
Can we talk later?

285
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.420 
I need some help.

286
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:49.500 
It's nice to see you.

287
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.580 
Let me know what you think.

288
00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:54.140 
I appreciate your understanding.

289
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:56.200 
I'm glad you're okay.

290
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:58.080 
What's going on?

291
00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:00.360 
I can't believe my eyes.

292
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.420 
I'd love to join you.

293
00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.520 
What do you mean by that?

294
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:06.420 
Can I get you something?

295
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:08.760 
I didn't think that would happen.

296
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.120 
I hope you feel better soon.

297
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:12.980 
You have a point.

298
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.400 
That's exactly what I needed.

299
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.240 
Can you help me out?

300
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.520 
It's always good to see you.

301
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:21.620 
I didn't expect that.

302
00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:23.580 
What do you want from me?

303
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.300 
I'll let you know.

304
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:27.840 
I'm really grateful for your help.

305
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:29.980 
That's just how it is.

306
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:32.340 
I'm really enjoying this.

307
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.520 
I can't help but feel.

308
00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:36.880 
What's your opinion on this?

309
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:38.820 
I'm working on it.

310
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.900 
I think we're making progress.

311
00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.080 
How did that happen?

312
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.120 
I'll be right back.

313
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:46.940 
It's been a while.

314
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.140 
I need to take a break.

315
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.220 
I'm in a bit of a rush.

316
00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:55.360 
I wish I could help more.

317
00:12:56.010 --> 00:12:57.480 
What's your favorite hobby?

318
00:12:58.390 --> 00:12:59.880 
I didn't know you felt that way.

319
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.380 
I'm sorry, but I can't.

320
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:04.440 
I'm glad to hear that.

321
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.640 
What's the plan for today?

322
00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.480 
I'll make it work.

323
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.420 
How was your weekend?

324
00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:12.200 
Can you show me?

325
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:14.180 
I'm not really sure.

326
00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.500 
What time do you want to meet?

327
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.320 
It doesn't matter.

328
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.680 
I'm trying to stay positive.

329
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.840 
Let's make it happen.

330
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:24.900 
I think we should talk.

331
00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:26.840 
Can we take a moment?

332
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.620 
What are you thinking?

333
00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:30.920 
I'm sorry for the confusion.

334
00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:33.480 
It was nice chatting with you.

335
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.620 
What's your favorite book?

336
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.940 
I can't get enough of this.

337
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.080 
I'm feeling overwhelmed.

338
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:42.380 
I'll keep that in mind.

339
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.480 
How about we do it later?

340
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.660 
What's your take on this?

341
00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:48.700 
I think you'll like it.

342
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.040 
I'm really busy at the moment.

343
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.640 
What are we going to do?

344
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:57.460 
It's good to know.

345
00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.660 
I've been thinking about you.

346
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.620 
Can you pass me that?

347
00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.200 
I appreciate your help with this.

348
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:06.560 
What do you expect me to do?

349
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.960 
I hope you have a great time.

350
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.520 
It's always a pleasure to see you.

351
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.720 
What do you want to talk about?

352
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:15.840 
I didn't realize that.

353
00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:17.920 
I think it's time to go.

354
00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.180 
What's your favorite restaurant?

355
00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.580 
I'm feeling a bit off today.

356
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.880 
Can we talk about this later?

357
00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.280 
I appreciate your honesty.

358
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:29.580 
What are you excited about?

359
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.840 
I'll have to check my schedule.

360
00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:34.120 
I didn't think I'd like it.

361
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.920 
It's hard to say.

362
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.440 
What's the best way to do this?

363
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:40.920 
Let's grab a coffee sometime.

364
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:42.800 
I'll give it a shot.

365
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.940 
What's your biggest goal?

366
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:47.260 
I'm really happy for you.

367
00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.680 
Let's take it step by step.

368

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:58.180 
Can we meet halfway?

372
00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.500 
I can't thank you enough.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:02.320 
I'm all ears.

374
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:04.620 
It's not what I expected.

375
00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:06.920 
What's your opinion on that?

What are your thoughts?

380
00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:17.220 
I can't make it today.

381
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:19.200 
Let's keep in touch.

382
00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:21.560 
I hope that works for you.

383
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:24.420 
I'm looking for a way to...

384
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:25.860 
What do you
need help with?

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:27.940 
I'm trying my best.

386
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:29.800

I didn't see that coming at all.

391
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.980 
How do you plan to do that?

392
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.040 
I think it's important.

393
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.440 
I'm not sure where to start.

394
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:48.680 
I'd like to hear your thoughts.

395
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:50.980

I can't stop thinking about...

406
00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:16.620 
What do

I'll figure something out.

411
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.380 
I'm not a fan of that.

412
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.880 
It's important to stay focused.

413
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:30.880 
What's on your mind?

414
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:32.920 
I didn't catch that.

Can you clarify that for me?

435
00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:23.900 
It's a tough decision.

436
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:26.120
