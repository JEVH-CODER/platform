Chapter 2.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.730
In the Police Station with a Strange Cop

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.970
Valeria is very desperate.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.670
She often worries about her brother.

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.010
But now it's different, her brother is missing.

6
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890
She's going to the police station to

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.470
report it.

8
00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.960
Good morning, sir.

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.880
I want to report a missing person.

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:30.560
Hello, miss.

11
00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.500
I'll be asking you some questions to file
the disappearance report.

12
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.220
All right.

13
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.540
Tell me, what's your full name?

14
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.540
Valeria Smith.

15
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.540
Who's the missing person?

16
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.340
My brother.

17
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.200
What's his full name?

18
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.040
David Smith.

19
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.720
Where are you from?

20
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.840
I'm from Texas.

21
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.640
Where is he from?

22
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.460
He's from Ohio.

23
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.820
He was born there.

24
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.400
How old are you?

25
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.220
I'm 35.

26
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.270
How old is he?

27
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.800
He's 28

28
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.940
Where do you live?

29
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.100
I live in Bronx.

30
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.940
Where does he live?

31
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.120
He also lives in Bronx.

32
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000
He lives with me and my family.

33
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:15.520
What do you do?

34
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.920
I'm a high school teacher.

35
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.580
I work in St. Louis School.

36
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.100
And your brother?

37
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.960
What does he do?

38
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.220
He's unemployed now, but he was a waiter.

39
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.980
Where did he work?

40
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340
He worked in McDonalds.

41
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.900
Is he married?

42
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.740
No, he's not married, but he has a girlfriend.

43
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.460
Does his girlfriend know he's missing?

44
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.540
I really don't know.

45
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.240
I haven't talked with her yet.

46
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.600
Can you please describe your brother?

47
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.160
Okay.

48
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.200
He's a good man, though he used to steal

49
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.560
my candies when we were little.

50
00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.300
And he doesn't like to take showers, but

51
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.360
he likes books, photographs, and food.

52
00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.860
Miss, are you kidding me?

53
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:01.820
Can you please help me?

54
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.160
Describe your brother physically.

55
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.360
Oh, sorry.

56
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.820
He's tall, short curly hair, brown eyes,

57
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.520
and he's skinny.

58
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.360
What was he wearing the last time you saw him?

59
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.040
He was wearing a blue shirt, green pants,
and black shoes.

60
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:18.940
And why is he missing?

61
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.580
What do you think?

62
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.560
I don't know.

63
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.380
He always tells me where he's going, but

64
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.000
this time, he didn't.

65
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.880
Okay, that's it.

66
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.220
You'll be called if necessary.

67
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.080
But do you know anything about him?

68
00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.440
I have got a lot of work to do.

69
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.800
Next.

70
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.080
Valeria leaves really worried.

71
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.340
St. Louis is a very big and dangerous city.

72
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.440
Where can he be?

73
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.960
She constantly asks herself.
