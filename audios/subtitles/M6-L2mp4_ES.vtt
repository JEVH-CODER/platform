1
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.340 
Hi, hi there.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.620 
Welcome to this lesson.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.020 
For today, we're going to watch a little
bit more about work, okay?

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.060 
And this is going to be a little bit more specific.

5
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.120 
Va a ser algo de trabajo un poco más específico.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
The first phrase we're going to watch is,
or we're going to study is, do you work

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.780 
in finances?

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.040 
Okay, do you work in finances?

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.600 
¿Trabajas en finanzas?

10
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.120 
Do you work in finances?

11
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.180 
So, do you work, recuerda que el do you
es siempre que le vas a preguntar a otra

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.520 
persona si hace algo.

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.140 
Entonces, do you work in finances?

14
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.180 
Say it with me.

15
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.290 
Pretty good, once again.

16
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.730 
Do you work in finances?

17
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.680 
Pretty good, nice, nice.

18
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.420 
And an answer can be, I work with the government.

19
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.320 
I work with the government.

20
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.540 
Esa puede ser una respuesta.

21
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.400 
I work with the government.

22
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.980 
You?

23
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.210 
Pretty good, nice.

24
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.310 
Once again, I work with the government.

25
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.000 
Pretty good, nice, nice.

26
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
So, another thing you can say is, I work
closely with the sales team.

27
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.940 
I work closely with the sales team.

28
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.560 
Trabajo muy de cerca o en estrecha

29
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.540 
colaboración con el equipo de ventas.

30
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.940 
I work closely with the sales team.

31
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.420 
So, closely means that you're familiar
with what you're talking about.

32
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
So, closely significa que estás cercano y
estás familiarizado con lo que estás hablando.

33
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.960 
Por ejemplo, si estás hablando, I work
closely with my sales team or with the

34
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.660 
sales teams.

35
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.760 
Quiere decir que estás muy familiarizado

36
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.000 
y que trabajas muy de cerca con el team
de ventas.

37
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.860 
So, I work closely with the sales team.

38
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.460 
You?

39
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.080 
Excellent, pretty nice.

40
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.260 
Once again, I work closely with the sales team.

41
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.920 
Real good.

42
00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
So, does he work in finances?

43
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.940 
Does he work in finances?

44
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.820 
Does he work in finances?

45
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.700 
So, recuerden que does he work in finances?

46
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.600 
Es que sí, él trabaja en finanzas.

47
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.860 
So, does he work in finances?

48
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.600 
Okay, pretty good.

49
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.060 
Once more.

50
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.680 
Does he work in finances?

51
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.740 
Does he work in finances?

52
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.140 
Working finances?

53
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.500 
Okay.

54
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.280 
Does he work in finances?

55
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:24.400 
Pretty good.

56
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.820 
Nice.

57
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.200 
Nice.

58
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.480 
So, he can say or a person can say that

59
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.300 
they can answer you.

60
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.100 
Te pueden responder.

61
00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.820 
He works as a corporate lawyer.

62
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.640 
So, él trabaja como un abogado corporativo.

63
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.040 
Entonces, corporate lawyer.

64
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.860 
He works as a corporate lawyer.

65
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.460

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
So, that was everything for today.

92
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.900 
Hey, remember that mistakes are proof

93
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:28.700 
that you're learning.

94
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.200 
Recuerda que los errores son la prueba de

95
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.280

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.760 
Okay.

97
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.000 
So, never give up.
