00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Deep in the cold waters of the North Atlantic, there is a fish that is unlike any other.

3
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The shark.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But in Iceland, they don't just catch it.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They let it rot.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Today, we are talking about "hákarl", a dish that is out of the ordinary.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The shark used for "hákarl" is a Greenland shark.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's flesh is toxic when fresh, but the ice landers have got a unique way to make it

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
safe.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They bury the meat and let it ferment for months.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The process is simple, but the result is something most people can't imagine.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Once the shark has been underground for weeks, it is hung out to dry.

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This part is essential, as it allows the toxins to break down.

14
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, the shark is ready to eat, but the smell is so strong that it can leave you out of

15
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
breath.

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Many people who try "hákarl" for the first time say it comes completely out of the blue.

17
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The taste is sharp, with an ammonia-like smell.

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
For some, it is out of place in their diet, but for ice landers, it is a tradition that

19
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
goes back centuries.

20
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The shark's fermentation process can be seen as out of control, but it's actually carefully

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
managed.

22
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Ice landers are proud of this dish, and while it is often out of sight for most tourists,

23
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
those who find it are in for a surprise.

24
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you ever visit Iceland, you might be out of luck if you don't find "hákarl" right

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
away, but it's there, waiting for the brave.

26
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Do you have the courage to try it?

27
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
"hákarl" is not for everyone.

28
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But it's a taste of Iceland that is out of the ordinary, and maybe, just maybe, it will

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
surprise you.
