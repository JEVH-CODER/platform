00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.280 
A couple of business owners were in a
tight spot after their last manager

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.760 
kicked
the

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.900 
bucket
following an attack

4
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.880 
.

5
00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.280 
They needed to find a new one, pronto.

6
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.800 
To make sure they picked the right
person, they sent in the cleaning lady to

7
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.840 
chat up the candidates on the sly
.

8
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.260 
The candidates had no clue it was all
part of the plan.

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.540 
The chats seemed like chill encounters,
focusing on what the candidates got up to

10
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.100 
on weekends.

11
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.200 
After she wrapped up her undercover

12
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.840 
mission, the cleaning lady gave her scoop
to the bosses.

13
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.340 
They strolled into the waiting room and
dropped the bomb, announcing one of the

14
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.960 
candidates as the new manager.
