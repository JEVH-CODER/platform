00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.120 
This is Warren Buffett, one of the
richest people in the world, thanks to

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.000 
the company he runs, Berkshire Hathaway.

3
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.440 
Basically, it's a holding company that

4
00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.320 
just owns a bunch of other companies,
Geico, Dairy Queen, a huge railroad, as

5
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.940 
well as a lot of stock in other
companies, like Apple and Coca -Cola.

6
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.760 
So when those companies do well and their
stock goes up, Berkshire Hathaway stock

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.160 
goes up.

8
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.160 
When Buffett took over the company in

9
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.140 
1965, a single share was worth $19.

10
00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.000 
Today, it's worth nearly half a million dollars.

11
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.660 
Buffett owns nearly 240 ,000 of these shares.

12
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.120 
This is where his wealth is.

13
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.340 
But as he's been known for pointing out,
Warren Buffett still pays a lower tax

14
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.440 
rate than his secretary.

15
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.300 
She pays at twice the rate I pay.

16
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900 
I think that's outrageous.

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.120 
That's because they pay different types

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.700 
of taxes.

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.440 
His secretary pays income taxes on her

20
00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.180 
salary, but Buffett mainly pays capital
gains taxes on his sold stock.

21
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.720 
And that's taxed at nearly half the rate.

22
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.060 
The wealthy are definitely under -taxed.

23
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.600 
In the US, the disparity between the
richest Americans and everyone else has

24
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:16.100 
been growing.

25
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.160 
And in the last 40 years, the after -tax

26
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
income of the richest has risen more than
400%, while middle -class income has only

27
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.260 
risen 50%.

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.520 
The way these people make money is very

29
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.640 
different than the way these people make money.

30
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.100 
And they're not taxed the same.

31
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.480 
I pay less in taxes than people that work
for a living and make as much money as I do.

32
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:43.420 
This is Morris.

33
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.920 
He used to work on Wall Street.

34
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.280 
Now, he's retired and lives off his many
stock market investments.

35
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.140 
I own stock in companies like Berkshire
Hathaway and Amazon and Apple.

36
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.080 
He's a pretty typical 1 -percenter,
except that he spends his money

37
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
advocating for rich people, like him, to
be taxed more.
