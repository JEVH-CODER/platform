00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.000 
Right there, right there.

2
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.600 
I love McDonald's.

3
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.500 
I love jobs.

4
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.620 
I like to see good jobs, and I think it's

5
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.220 
inappropriate when somebody puts down all
over the place that she worked at McDonald's.

6
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
It was a big part of her resume that she
worked at McDonald's, how tough a job it was.

7
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.880 
She specifically worked at the French
fry, where they make the French fries,

8
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.920 
and she talked about the heat.

9
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.840 
It was so tough.

10
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.500 
She never worked at McDonald's.

11
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.240 
Keep it tight.

12
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.240 
We've got the salt on it.

13
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.160 
It never touches the human hand.

14
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:22.780 
Nice and full.
