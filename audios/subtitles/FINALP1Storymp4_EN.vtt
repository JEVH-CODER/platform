1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.513
Johnny is walking down the street.

2
00:00:01.523 --> 00:00:03.740
He just got off work and is going to

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.663
visit a neighbor who's under the weather.

4
00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.100
To get to his sick friend's house, he has

5
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.340
to cross a dark and lonely alley.

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.660
There have been stories about people

7
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.200
getting mugged in that very alley.

8
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.480
Johnny doesn't want to go through there,

9
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.860
but he promised his wife he'd take the
miracle soup to the ailing old man.

10
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.160
Johnny finally bites the bullet and goes
through the alley.

11
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.980
Just as he's about to reach the house,
he's intercepted by a hooded man.

12
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.780
Johnny starts to sweat bullets.

13
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.000
The man asks, How are you?

14
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.780
How is it going?

15
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.640
Johnny is surprised.

16
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.800
This is a polite robber, he thinks.

17
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.680
He responds, Very well, thank God.

18
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.220
The robber then asks, Where do you live?

19
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:41.740
Do you live in that house at the end?

20
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.500
Out of fear that the man might think he's
a spy, Johnny says yes.

21
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.740
The man gives him a beating for lying.

22
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.240
The man knew Johnny didn't live there.

23
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.840
This hooded man was the son of the sick
old man.

24
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.420
He was trying to guard his dad from
scoundrels who would love to rob him.
