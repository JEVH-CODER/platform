1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.140 
A group of people was huddled up in a
dark room.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.960 
The atmosphere was thick with tension,
like they were hiding out.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.040 
At the same time, there was so much
commotion that many feared getting caught

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.340 
with their hands in the cookie jar.

5
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.940 
Things were rough back home, so they had

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.120 
a major fork in the road.

7
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:17.160 
Stick around and keep grinding for a

8
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.920 
better life, or pack up and roll the dice
elsewhere, hoping for a better shot.

9
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.160 
Everyone was on board with the idea of
leaving, even though it was a real tough call.

10
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.080 
The next snag was picking which country
to head to.

11
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.640 
Some were itching to hit up Italy because
they figured Italian would be a breeze to

12
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.020 
pick up.

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.400 
Others had their eyes on Australia,

14
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.000 
thinking they could lay low in the
jungles without anyone catching on.

15
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.560 
And a few were gunning for the United
States, since it's the so -called world's

16
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
leading power and land of the free.

17
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.140 
This crew of about 400 people huddled up

18
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.080 
to hash things out.

19
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:54.880 
Australia got the boot first because it

20
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.960 
was on the far side of the planet, and
they'd have to sail forever.

21
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.460 
That left only two choices, Italy and the
United States.

22
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.160 
They took a vote, and the result was a landslide.
