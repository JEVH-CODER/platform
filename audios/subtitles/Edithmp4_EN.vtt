Recuerda que la meta es que puedas

5
00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.100 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.500 
Come with us to the beach.

7
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.820 
Christopher wants to go, but his little
brother says, Mom said no.

8
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.920 
I will come back soon, says Christopher.

9
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.260 
At the beach, Christopher swims.

10
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.620 
His legs hurt.

11
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.260 
He cannot swim.

12
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.320 
Help, he says.

13
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.580 
His friends do not help.

14
00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.880 
They go home.

15
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:52.920 
At home, Edith is sad.

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.580 
Where is Christopher?

17
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.160 
He went to the beach, says his little brother.

18
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.180 
Edith looks for Christopher.

19
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.860 
She cannot find him.

20
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.500 
Three days later, people find Christopher.

21
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.260 
He is tired, but okay.

22
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.560 
They bring him home.

23
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.240 
Edith hugs Christopher.

24
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780 
Don't go outside without telling me, she says.

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.980 
I promise, Mom, says Christopher.

26
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.780 
Now Christopher is good.

27
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.140 
He stays with his family.
