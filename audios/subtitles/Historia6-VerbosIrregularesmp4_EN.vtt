00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.360 
Mia Hurts For Those In Need
She hurt deeply when she saw homeless

2
00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.760 
people last winter and has hurt quietly
for years, motivating her volunteer work.

3
00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.480 
She leads a local charity now.

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.460 
She led a successful fundraising campaign

5
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.600 
last year and has led many community
projects since then.

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.100 
Mia lends a helping hand to everyone she can.

7
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.820 
She lent her car to a neighbor in need

8
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.580 
last week and has lent support to
countless individuals.

9
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.760 
She rides her bike to volunteer sites.

10
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.940 
She rode 10 miles to a shelter yesterday

11
00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.640 
and has ridden hundreds of miles for
charity this year.

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.940 
The sun rises early and so does Mia.

13
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.220 
It rose at 5 a .m. this morning and she

14
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.080 
has risen with it every day this summer.

15
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.360 
Mia shoots videos for the charity's website.

16
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.660 
She shot an inspiring documentary last
month and has shot many promotional clips

17
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.140 
this year.

18
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.380 
Sometimes, Mia's heart sinks when she

19
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.100 
sees suffering.

20
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.900 
It sank when she visited a rundown school

21
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.740 
last week, but her spirit has sunk only
momentarily before rising again with determination.

22
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.040 
She tears apart every challenge that
comes her way.

23
00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.580 
She tore her jacket while rushing to an
important meeting yesterday, but her

24
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
dedication has torn apart doubts about
her leadership.

25
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.080 
Mia throws herself into her work.

26
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.100 
She threw a big charity event last month

27
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.420 
and has thrown her whole heart into
making a difference.

28
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.220 
She wears the charity's t -shirt like a
badge of honor.

29
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.540 
Yesterday, she wore it to an interview
and she has worn it for years, reminding

30
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.340 
her of her journey.
