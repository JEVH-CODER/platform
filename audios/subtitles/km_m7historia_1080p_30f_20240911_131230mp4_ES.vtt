Esto es una producción de Choco Inglés.

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.240 
Escucha esta producción varias veces

3
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.860 
hasta que la entiendas bien.

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.320 
Recuerda que la meta es que puedes

5
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.960 
comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

6
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.580 
Valeria arrived home, exhausted and worried.

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.400 
As she walked into the living room, she
found her parents sitting on the couch,

8
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.660 
engrossed in a political debate on TV.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.220 
Hi.

10
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.620 
Valeria said, her voice tight with frustration.

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.860 
What are you doing?

12
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.200 
David is missing.

13
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.380 
Her parents barely looked up from the screen.

14
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.740 
Oh, hello Valeria.

15
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.800 
We're just discussing the latest news.

16
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.860 
Her mother replied, You should join us.

17
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.560 
What do you think about the new policies?

18
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.000 
Valeria's anger flared.

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.100 
How can you sit here and watch TV when

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.000 
your son is out there somewhere, missing?

21
00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.400 
This is outrageous.

22
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.140 
Her father sighed and said, You should
calm yourself.

23
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.560 
That's not our problem.

24
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.120 
Valeria couldn't believe her ears.

25
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.140 
Why do you say this isn't our problem?

26
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.500 
Because it's not our business.

27
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.300 
Her mother said matter -of -factly.

28
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.460 
What do you mean?

29
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.360 
Valeria demanded.

30
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.380 
He's our relative, my brother and your son

31
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.680 
.

32
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.740 
No, he's not.

33
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.340 
Her father said, You see, when we got
married, we wanted children but couldn't

34
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.860 
have one.

35
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.740 
One day, the pastor called us.

36
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.420 
Come over to my house, please.

37
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.240 
He said, When we arrived, he showed us a baby.

38
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.200 
We found him in the church basement.

39
00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.980 
Someone must have abandoned him there,

40
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.360 
yet we mustn't do the same.

41
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.460 
And I know you want children, and he

42
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.780 
can't take care of himself.

43
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.420 
The pastor said, So, we took him in.

44
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.220 
After all, he was right, we wanted a
baby, and he couldn't take care of himself

45
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.720 
. Valeria's face turned pale.

46
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.060 
And so?

47
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.440 
He's your adopted son, but he's still
your son.

48
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.020 
He's still part of our family, we have to
help him.

49
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.220 
No, we don't have to.

50
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.360 
Her father said firmly, We never

51
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.220 
officialized the adoption, and he's
already of age.

52
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.340 
Valeria left the house, feeling indignant.

53
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.140 
She walked quickly to the church, to

54
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.220 
speak with the pastor.

55
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.440 
She really didn't use to go to church on Mondays.

56
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.820 
But this was an emergency.

57
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.620 
She found the pastor praying in one of

58
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.260 
the benches.

59
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.980 
I'd like to talk with you.

60
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.640 
Valeria said urgently, Oh, Valeria, what
a surprise.

61
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.140 
Are you getting used to praying and
attending church on Mondays too?

62
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.920 
The pastor asked, looking up.

63
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.020 
I would like to talk with you.

64
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.640 
Valeria repeated.

65
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.320 
My parents don't want to help my brother,

66
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.000 
and they might change their minds if you
talk to them.

67
00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.960 
Well, they might or might not change
their minds.

68
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.880 
Anyways, tell me what happened.

69
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.380 
Anguished, Valeria talked about the

70
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.960 
situation with the pastor.

71
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.880 
So, I think they should help anyway.

72
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.820 
They shouldn't turn their backs on him now.

73
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.380 
What do you think about it

74
00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.720 
?

75
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.560 
The pastor listened carefully and said

76
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.520 
, Well, let me tell you a story.
