1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.800 
All right.

2
00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.100 
Welcome back to this lesson.

3
00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.140 
I'm Teacher Junior.

4
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.520 
And let's check it out right away.

5
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:05.720 
Vamos a verla de una vez.

6
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.820 
So tenemos la primera frase que es which

7
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.120 
city are you from?

8
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.900 
So city are you from?

9
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.800 
Eso ya lo sabemos.

10
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.060 
City es una ciudad.

11
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.020 
And are you from?

12
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.440 
Que es la pregunta como la parte de where

13
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.920 
are you from?

14
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.560 
De dónde eres?

15
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.080 
O what country are you from?

16
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.120 
De qué país eres?

17
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.440 
Ok.

18
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.880 
Esas preguntas que ya hemos visto.

19
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.580 
Pero ahora tenemos una en específico que
es which city are you from?

20
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.040 
So let's check out the word which.

21
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.460 
Vamos a ver la palabra which.

22
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.080 
If you jump a moment before the elevator
hits the bottom, you will somehow

23
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.000 
decrease the impact on your body.

24
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.260 
Firstly, how are you planning to

25
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.800 
understand when you should jump?

26
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.600 
You can't see through metal, can you?

27
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.960 
Secondly, even if you somehow manage to
jump, which is extremely difficult due to

28
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.500 
being in a freefall, the speed decrease
you can hope for is about 2 miles per

29
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.400 
hour or 3 kilometers per hour.

30
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.060 
It's definitely not enough to save your life.

31
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.420 
What is worse, you might hurt yourself
badly if you hit the ceiling with your head.

32
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.800 
Jumping is not worth the risk at all.

33
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.260 
Mythbusters tested this approach.

34
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.840 
Believe us, it didn't end well for the
dummy inside the elevator.

35
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.140 
Standing up straight and hoping for the
best is also not the best idea.

36
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.640 
Nothing good is coming.

37
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.440 
What is coming is a weight 10 times

38
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.860 
larger than that of your own body
dropping on your legs at the moment of impact.

39
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.480 
Now, with all due respect, neither you
nor anyone else can survive that.

40
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.780 
So, now that we're clear of what you
should never do in a falling elevator,

41
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.020 
let's get to the best course of action.

42
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.760 
Your best bet would be to lie flat on

43
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.200 
your back.

44
00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.280 
This position will help you distribute

45
00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.840 
the force of the impact across your
entire body.

46
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.860 
Yes, your small thin bones will probably
snap anyway, though it mostly depends on

47
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.940 
how high up you were when the cable snapped.

48
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.280 
But it might help you avoid more serious damage.

49
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.200 
Or not.

50
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.880 
Nobody is absolutely certain.

51
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.420 
It's probably pretty hard to think
clearly in such a situation

52
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.100 
.

53
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.740 
But you should also remember to cover

54
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.500 
your head with your hands.

55
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.560 
When the elevator lands, it will most

56
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.720 
likely be destroyed.

57
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.920 
So, protecting your head from debris

58
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.380 
might save your life.

59
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.700 
If you're trapped under an avalanche,

60
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.280 
spitting can help you out.

61
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.440 
As soon as you stop moving, make a little

62
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.100 
hole around your face.

63
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.020 
Spit in the air pocket and see where

64
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.620 
gravity carries your saliva.

65
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.060 
Then start making your way out by digging

66
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.180 
in the opposite direction.

67
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.280 
If suddenly you notice that the water

68
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.180 
recedes quickly and unexpectedly from a
beach exposing the ocean floor, you

69
00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.040 
should warn everyone around and get away
as fast as you can.

70
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.420 
Because when the waterline is abnormally
far from the shore, this is a sign of a tsunami.

71
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.660 
No air pump and a flat tire is a bad
combo when you're far from home.

72
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.580 
To fix your bike, grab a bunch of grass
or leaves and evenly pack the tire with

73
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.080 
as much as possible.

74
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.500 
That will be enough to reach a safe place.

75
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.760 
Now, do you know any other tricks to fix
a flat tire without an air pump?

76
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.540 
Share your wisdom in the comments below.

77
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.820 
If you're under attack by a moose, those

78
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.340 
creatures are huge, try to hide behind a tree.

79
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.400 
Those animals have a blind spot in their

80
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.100 
peripheral vision
, so they will lose you and you can

81
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.220 
escape easier.

82
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.480 
If a black bear is chasing you, remember

83
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.300 
that you shouldn't turn your back on this
animal or try to run.

84
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.840 
Either of these actions can make them hostile.

85
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.320 
Your best bet is to lie flat on your

86
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.040 
stomach to protect your organs, crossing
your hands behind your neck to guard your

87
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.520 
arteries to convince the bear you don't
pose any threat.

88
00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.880 
Also, don't climb a tree.

89
00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.680 
They do it better than you.

90
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.620 
Oh, and if you see Yogi Bear, don't try
to look like a picnic basket.

91
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.200 
He'll steal you every time.

92
00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.020 
For example, over here, de estas

93
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.360 
situaciones, which one would you choose?

94
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.400 
¿Cuál escogerías?

95
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.820 
Which one?

96
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.400 
Well, I want you to write it in the

97
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.480 
comments down below.

98
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.940 
Escríbelo allá abajo en los comentarios.

99
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.060 
Which situation would you prefer?

100
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.020 
¿Cuál situación preferirías?

101
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.600 
All right, so now, repeat after me.

102
00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.140 
Repite conmigo.

103
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.660 
Which city are you from?

104
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.240 
That's great.

105
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.500 
Once more.

106
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.900 
Which city are you from?

107
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.760 
Pretty good.

108
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.880 
That's excellent.

109
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.120 
Now, let's check the next one.

110
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.540 
Vamos a ver cómo puedes responder.

111
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.420 
Tenemos este formato de aquí.

112
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.900 
My hometown is, y dices tu ciudad, en

113
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.680 
este caso tenemos Reading.

114
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.040 
It's near London.

115
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.800 
Mi ciudad natal es Reading y está near,
cerca de London.

116
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.900 
Londres.

117
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.260 
All right, so we already know a little

118
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.240 
bit about London.

119
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.160 
Nosotros ya hemos visto algo acerca de London.

120
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.100 
And now we're going to check Reading.

121
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:32.240 
Vamos a ver este corto video de Reading.

122
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.060 
So, that's great.

123
00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.920 
Now, you could say, tú podrías decir, my

124
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.300 
hometown is Reading.

125
00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.200 
Dilo conmigo.

126
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.180 
My hometown is Reading.

127
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.880 
Pretty good.

128
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.580 
That's right.

129
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:44.460 
Once more.

130
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.680 
My hometown is Reading.

131
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.200 
That's great.

132
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.800 
That's great.

133
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:51.560 
Ahora, quiero que lo reemplaces con tu hometown.

134
00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.040 
Con tu ciudad natal.

135
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.940 
My hometown is...

136
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:57.680 
Pretty good.

137
00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:58.880 
Pretty good.

138
00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.240 
Excellent.

139
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.000 
Now, next up.

140
00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:05.080 
La siguiente que tenemos es big town and
quite small.

141
00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.160 
All right?

142
00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.060 
Big and small.

143
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:14.620 
Vamos a ver en este video cuáles son las
cosas más big, más grandes of the

144
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:15.840 
universe, del universo.

145
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.060 
And what are the things that are quite small?

146
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.720 
Y cuáles son las cosas que son bien
pequeñas in the universe.

147
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:26.260 
Performing a size comparison of the
entire universe will unearth some

148
00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.400 
astonishing facts.

149
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.420 
Let us begin our journey from smallest to largest.

150
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.300 
Basetime fabric.

151
00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.140 
The foundation of the universe.

152
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:39.160 
Going any smaller than this will defy the
laws of physics.

153
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.400 
Planck particle.

154
00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.600 
The smallest thing in existence.

155
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:46.160 
The largest known moon.

156
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.560 
Ganymede.

157
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.260 
Finally, this is us.

158
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:49.760 
Everyone you know.

159
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:56.260 
Every religion, ideology, conflict, every
experience, every saint and sinner in the

160
00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:01.260 
history of our species lives out here.

161
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.280 
Other planets.

162
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:08.180 
The largest being Jupiter, which can fit
1 ,300 Earths inside of it.

163
00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.280 
The sun.

164
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.300 
A ball of superheated gas which can fit a

165
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.120 
million Earths inside of it.

166
00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:16.300 
Stars.

167
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.980 
Polaris.

168
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.300 
Polaris.

169
00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.620 
Over 10 ,000 times bigger than our own sun.

170
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.020 
The pistol star.

171
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.200 
3 ,000 times bigger than Polaris.

172
00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.180 
If this had the same location as our sun,

173
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:30.420 
it would reach as far as Mars.

174
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.780 
So, whenever someone asks you, what city

175
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.040 
are you from?

176
00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.720 
You could say, I come from a big town.

177
00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.440 
Para decir, yo vengo de una big, una gran ciudad.

178
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.140 
A town.

179
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.520 
Alright?

180
00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.080 
Town es también similar a city.

181
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.200 
Solo que city es más grande que town.

182
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.440 
¿Ok?

183
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:53.020 
So, tenemos city, town y village.

184
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.160 
Ahora, puedes decir, I come from a big town.

185
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.680 
Pretty good.

186
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:59.160 
Pretty good.

187
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.180 
Si vienes de una big town, de una ciudad
grande, dices eso.

188
00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:08.980 
And now, if you say, si tú vienes de un
pueblo, then you could say, my village is

189
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.840 
quite small.

190
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.960 
¿Ok?

191
00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:11.800 
Say it with me.

192
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.960 
Dilo conmigo.

193
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:16.500 
My village is quite small.

194
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:17.100 
Pretty good.

195
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.340 
Once more.

196
00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.780 
My village is quite small.

197
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.120 
Pretty good.

198
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.480 
That's how you do it.

199
00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:26.640 
Eso significa, mi pueblo es bastante pequeño.

200
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:26.860 
Alright?

201
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:31.820 
So, now, I would like to hear in the

Más de 4 expresiones.

220
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.600

221
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:09.140
