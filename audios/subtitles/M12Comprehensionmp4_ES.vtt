00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.560 
Ok, estas preguntas van a estar bien interesantes.

2
00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:03.940 
Estas preguntas van a ser muy

3
00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.740 
interesantes, so put your answers in the
comments below.

4
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.640 
Be honest.

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.320 
1.

6
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.720 
Alex, for instance, back in the early
20s, some governments used to restrict

7
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.180 
internet access during times of political unrest.

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.200 
So what did governments do during times

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.640 
of political unrest in the early 20s?

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.560 
Next.

11
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
Jamie, the prohibition of social media
would likely lead to unintended consequences.

12
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.280 
For example, when governments prohibited
social media in the past, the results

13
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.180 
were often counterproductive.

14
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.380 
Ok, so the question is, what was the

15
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.140 
common outcome when governments banned
social media in the past according to Jamie?

16
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.400 
Next, number 3.

17
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.000 
Jamie, the future of social media and its

18
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.740 
role in society should be managed with
careful thought rather than sweeping bans.

19
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.320 
So, what does Jamie suggest that should
be done with social media instead of

20
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.320 
banning it?

21
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.580 
What does Jamie suggest that should be

22
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.700 
done instead of banning social media?

23
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.420

three

31

.
