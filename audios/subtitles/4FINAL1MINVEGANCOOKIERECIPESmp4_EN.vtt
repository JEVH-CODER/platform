Today is a beautiful day because we're gonna bake loads of cookies

2
00:00:06.196 --> 00:00:10.872 
All of these are easy One Bowl recipes and the cookies that result are soft and chewy

3
00:00:11.376 --> 00:00:16.388 
Just the way I like them as always you can find the link to the blog post in the description box below for the full

4
00:00:16.388 --> 00:00:22.274 
Breakdown of the recipes and no more introduction needed. I'm sure you're ready to dive in as am I so let's get started

5
00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:25.302 
We'll start by making these peanut butter and chocolate oatmeal cookies

6
00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:31.323 
Which take only 15 minutes to make from start to finish and use just seven ingredients with no added sugar oil or flour

7
00:00:31.693 --> 00:00:37.411 
For those who use metric measurements like grams and milliliters, please note. I always include this in my blog post

8
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.395 
So check the links in the description box below

9
00:00:39.597 --> 00:00:43.499 
Now this recipe calls for quick oats, but if like me you only have regular oats

10
00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.948 
You can always make your own by throwing them into a food processor and blend until coarsely chopped now

11
00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:54.263 
You're just gonna want to add the bananas to a large bowl and mash until you achieve a rather fluid consistency

12
00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:58.938 
Then you add the vanilla extract and peanut butter and mix it all together at this point

13
00:00:58.938 --> 00:01:03.243 
You can add the cranberries roasted coconut flakes chocolate and oats

14
00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.751 
Stirring until it's all well combined. The mixture should create about 12 cookies

15
00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:12.258 
So you'll first roll it into a ball and then press it down to create a cookie shape

16
00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:18.010 
Place it on a cookie tray lined with baking paper and you don't need to leave so much room between the cookies because they won't

17
00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:21.273 
Spread bake it in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit or 180

18
00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:25.141 
Celsius for about 10 to 12 minutes or until the tops turn golden

19
00:01:25.309 --> 00:01:30.960 
Remove it from the oven and allow it to cool for a couple of minutes before you transfer it to a cooling rack to cool

20
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.473 
completely in my opinion

21
00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:35.871 
These cookies can hardly be called dessert in the conventional sense and that they're just too

22
00:01:35.972 --> 00:01:40.647 
Wholesome and make for a wonderful snack that anyone will enjoy kids or adults alike

23
00:01:40.748 --> 00:01:44.919 
This is just to show you how soft and chewy the cookies are and they taste so good

24
00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:47.105 
You won't even believe that they're so healthy, too

25
00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:54.539 
All right moving on to cookie recipe number two blueberry almond breakfast cookies as a recipe name suggests

26
00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.196 
These cookies can make for a quick grab and go breakfast

27
00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.147 
If you really can't find a time for a sit-down meal

28
00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:03.049 
But I personally use it more as a snack or dessert like the previous recipe

29
00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.926 
These cookies are made with no added sugar oil or flour and feature some super wholesome ingredients

30
00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:11.525 
including antioxidant rich blueberries fiber and omega-3

31
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:18.656 
Powerhouses like flax and chia seeds as well as apple sauce and a banana which not only add natural sweetness

32
00:02:18.723 --> 00:02:25.854 
But also functions similarly to oil in baked treats, but of course, these fruits are much more nutritious than oil now

33
00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:29.924 
We're going to create our own almond meal by grinding up the almonds in a food processor until

34
00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:31.505 
It makes a coarse flour

35
00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:33.927 
Then we're gonna chop some dairy free dark chocolate

36
00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:35.239 
And if you're not a fan of chocolate

37
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.553 
You can always substitute it out in any of these recipes for nuts seeds or dried fruits of your choosing

38
00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:48.424 
We'll start again with a banana mashing it completely before we add the applesauce almond butter and vanilla extract then stir to combine

39
00:02:50.173 --> 00:02:57.136 
Then you can add the almond meal ground flax seeds and chia seeds stirring before you then add the baking soda cinnamon and salt

40
00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:04.401 
Then you'll add the oats and pumpkin seeds stirring. Once again before you add the chocolate and blueberries at the very end

41
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.346 
You're gonna want to fold these in gently so that the blueberries don't bleed so much into the dough

42
00:03:11.162 --> 00:03:15.468 
Much like before we're gonna roll this dough into a bowl and then press it into a cookie shape

43
00:03:15.602 --> 00:03:17.789 
This should make about 10 cookies in total

44
00:03:20.614 --> 00:03:26.568 
Always reserved a few chunks of chocolate to place on top as well for presentation before you bake it in the oven at 350

45
00:03:26.803 --> 00:03:33.564 
Fahrenheit or 180 Celsius for about 15 minutes or until it's lightly golden then allow it to cool for a couple minutes

46
00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.206 
Before you again transfer it to a cooling rack. These cookies are so delicious

47
00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:42.780 
It's really just a bonus that they're loaded with grains seeds nuts and fruit

48
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.386 
I

49
00:03:43.386 --> 00:03:50.147 
Especially like to enjoy it with some homemade chai tea and fresh fruit when my sweet tooth strikes and I can say with all honesty

50
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.880 
I now prefer these to the super sweet conventional store-bought cookies

51
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.706 
I used to eat before I used to eat them because they were

52
00:03:56.874 --> 00:04:00.944 
convenient but these cookies can be too and we now usually make a big batch and then

53
00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:06.090 
Individually wrap them and freeze them to enjoy as on-demand desserts or grab-and-go snacks

54
00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.396 
We're gonna move on to our final recipe now classic chocolate chip cookies

55
00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:13.154 
Now the previous two recipes were super wholesome

56
00:04:13.154 --> 00:04:19.915 
But I'm not averse to having some more indulgent treats sometimes too and this recipe makes for a wonderful housewarming or potluck

57
00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:25.599 
Contribution if you choose I once took it to Robyn's family's gathering and no one noticed they were vegan

58
00:04:25.734 --> 00:04:26.239 
No

59
00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:29.871 
Hidden or strange ingredients in this recipe and here's a little tip

60
00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:36.027 
You'll want to use refined coconut oil instead of unrefined oil to avoid any pronounced coconut flavor in the cookies

61
00:04:36.195 --> 00:04:40.601 
The coconut oil really just functions similarly to butter and normal cookie recipes

62
00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:45.848 
Another tip is to reserve some of the chocolate bits for presentation on top of the cookies at the end

63
00:04:46.017 --> 00:04:50.356 
You'll notice I did this with every recipe in this video now to a large bowl

64
00:04:50.356 --> 00:04:53.181 
You'll want to cream together some solid coconut oil and brown sugar

65
00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:57.285 
If the coconut oil is liquid just place it in the fridge for a bit to harden first

66
00:04:57.621 --> 00:05:01.288 
one screamed at the maple syrup plant milk vanilla extract

67
00:05:01.893 --> 00:05:06.568 
Baking soda salt and baking powder and mix it again until well combined

68
00:05:06.703 --> 00:05:09.697 
The mixture is going to look clumpy and that's okay

69
00:05:09.798 --> 00:05:12.118 
Now if the temperature is warm where you are

70
00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:16.121 
You might want to consider chilling this mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up

71
00:05:16.458 --> 00:05:20.561 
Otherwise the cookies flatten and spread a little bit too much when it's baking in the oven

72
00:05:20.965 --> 00:05:23.588 
But if the temperature is cool in your working space

73
00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:29.643 
you can just omit this step then mix it together one more time before you add the flour and stir until it's just

74
00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:35.529 
Combined but be careful not to over mix then you can add the chocolate chunks and gently fold it in

75
00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:40.238 
Now we're gonna form little balls out of the dough and evenly distribute them about five

76
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:44.241 
Centimeters or two inches apart because the cookies will certainly spread when it's baking

77
00:05:44.611 --> 00:05:49.354 
Top it with the reserved chocolate chunks before you bake it in the oven at 350 Fahrenheit or 180

78
00:05:49.556 --> 00:05:56.451 
Celsius for 12 to 15 minutes or until it's lightly golden the recipe is gonna make about 18 to 20 cookies altogether

79
00:05:56.989 --> 00:06:00.521 
Enjoy it with coffee tea a chai or simply on its own

80
00:06:02.438 --> 00:06:08.392 
Sometimes a good old classic will hit the spot and it's always rewarding to know you made it yourself from plant-based ingredients

81
00:06:09.031 --> 00:06:16.128 
I'll again show you how the cookie comes apart when it's been cooled. The texture is soft and the flavor is oh so indulgent

82
00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.840 
Now I'm curious to know what's your favorite kind of cookie share it with me in the comment section just down below
