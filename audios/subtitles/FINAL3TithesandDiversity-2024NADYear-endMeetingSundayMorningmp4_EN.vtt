00:00:18.567 --> 00:00:20.114 
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.670 
Welcome to another day,

3
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.646 
and welcome to another

4
00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:24.621 
meeting.

5
00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:25.563 
Let's bow our heads

6
00:00:25.563 --> 00:00:26.841 
together for prayer

7
00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.826 
before we begin.

8
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.777 
Dear Heavenly Father,

9
00:00:30.777 --> 00:00:32.156 
we thank You for a brand

10
00:00:32.156 --> 00:00:33.299 
new day, and we thank

11
00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.073 
You for the gift of

12
00:00:34.073 --> 00:00:35.385 
life.

13
00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:36.428 
Before we begin this

14
00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:37.437 
day's activities, Lord,

15
00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:38.479 
we want to take time to

16
00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.296 
spend in Your Word,

17
00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:41.877 
to reflect on it, and

18
00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:42.718 
to respond to the

19
00:00:42.718 --> 00:00:43.727 
message that You have in

20
00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:45.543 
store for us.

21
00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:46.485 
We invite your Holy

22
00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.234 
Spirit into this place

23
00:00:48.234 --> 00:00:49.882 
and into our hearts.

24
00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:50.858 
Speak to us this

25
00:00:50.858 --> 00:00:51.194 
morning.

26
00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:52.438 
We pray in Jesus name,

27
00:00:52.438 --> 00:00:54.019 
Amen.

28
00:00:58.325 --> 00:00:59.166 
Thank you, Elder

29
00:00:59.166 --> 00:00:59.906 
Robinson, for a

30
00:00:59.906 --> 00:01:01.621 
powerful.

31
00:01:01.621 --> 00:01:02.832 
Message this morning can

32
00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:04.985 
we say amen everyone?

33
00:01:04.985 --> 00:01:06.902 
Thank you.

34
00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:12.116 
Powerful testimony.

35
00:01:13.192 --> 00:01:15.715 
And encouraging.

36
00:01:17.195 --> 00:01:18.507 
Inspirational devotional

37
00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:20.458 
this morning.

38
00:01:22.072 --> 00:01:24.393 
As we get started.

39
00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:29.708 
Lord bless us, we had

40
00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:31.995 
a beautiful Sabbath day

41
00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:33.508 
yesterday and Friday

42
00:01:33.508 --> 00:01:35.628 
evening our worship

43
00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:37.477 
together.

44
00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:38.419 
Communing together.

45
00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:40.202 
Lord was with us and He

46
00:01:40.202 --> 00:01:42.758 
visited this place.

47
00:01:42.927 --> 00:01:44.137 
As we get started this

48
00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.400 
morning, before we

49
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.914 
go to the first item on

50
00:01:48.914 --> 00:01:50.327 
the agenda, I've invited

51
00:01:50.327 --> 00:01:53.354 
and asked a member of our

52
00:01:53.354 --> 00:01:54.565 
staff to join us.

53
00:01:54.565 --> 00:01:55.540 
And before she comes,

54
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.314 
I just want to share a

55
00:01:56.314 --> 00:01:58.265 
few remarks.

56
00:01:58.736 --> 00:01:59.442 
We're going to spend a

57
00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.057 
little time in prayer,

58
00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:01.797 
but I've asked her

59
00:02:01.797 --> 00:02:02.839 
specifically if she

60
00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:04.958 
would come and lead us

61
00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:06.977 
in a prayer session for

62
00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:08.322 
our families, especially

63
00:02:08.322 --> 00:02:10.105 
our children.

64
00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:19.691 
Thank you so much.

65
00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:22.752 
Pastor Benita Shields is

66
00:02:22.752 --> 00:02:24.030 
an associate secretary

67
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.938 
for North American

68
00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:26.788 
Division, And I thank

69
00:02:26.788 --> 00:02:28.235 
you for leading us this

70
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:30.017 
morning.

71
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.751 
Now we're going to move

72
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:36.206 
into another item.

73
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.855 
That we typically do on

74
00:02:37.855 --> 00:02:39.637 
Sunday, and that's

75
00:02:39.637 --> 00:02:40.781 
taking time.

76
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:42.698 
And we will just do this

77
00:02:42.698 --> 00:02:44.279 
in silent prayer to

78
00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:45.255 
remember those that we

79
00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:46.432 
have lost who were once

80
00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.383 
part of this executive

81
00:02:48.383 --> 00:02:49.695 
committee, that we've

82
00:02:49.695 --> 00:02:51.511 
lost over the last year.

83
00:02:51.915 --> 00:02:52.789 
And there are a couple

84
00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:53.798 
of others we would like

85
00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:55.379 
to add to that.

86
00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.422 
We would like to

87
00:02:56.422 --> 00:02:57.801 
remember.

88
00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:00.256 
Carmen Griffin.

89
00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:01.299 
Buford Griffin, who

90
00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.746 
was once a member here.

91
00:03:02.746 --> 00:03:04.293 
His wife passed last

92
00:03:04.293 --> 00:03:06.748 
week from the Southwest

93
00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:07.959 
Union.

94
00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.170 
And we want to remember

95
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.457 
that family and prayer.

96
00:03:11.457 --> 00:03:13.677 
And also Kim Gator,

97
00:03:13.677 --> 00:03:14.585 
vice president of

98
00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:16.267 
education for South

99
00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:18.487 
Atlantic Conference.

100
00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:20.236 
For special prayer

101
00:03:20.236 --> 00:03:21.515 
because of medical

102
00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:22.625 
challenge just this

103
00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.306 
week.

104
00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:27.603 
So we see the names

105
00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.486 
before us.

106
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.481 
Thank you everyone for

107
00:04:35.481 --> 00:04:36.927 
this.

108
00:04:41.165 --> 00:04:41.939 
Thank you.

109
00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:42.679 
Thank you.

110
00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:43.856 
Let me first give you a

111
00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:44.596 
report on our

112
00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:45.639 
memberships.

113
00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.085 
As of the second quarter

114
00:04:47.085 --> 00:04:48.700 
of this year, we had

115
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.308 
1,268,572

116
00:04:53.308 --> 00:04:55.259 
members.

117
00:04:55.763 --> 00:04:57.445 
That is a net gain of

118
00:04:57.445 --> 00:04:59.968 
more than 10,000 members

119
00:04:59.968 --> 00:05:01.179 
from 2023.

120
00:05:03.702 --> 00:05:05.350 
By the end of 2024,

121
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.964 
we project that we will

122
00:05:06.964 --> 00:05:09.016 
have more than 20,000

123
00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:11.707 
net gains in membership.

124
00:05:11.707 --> 00:05:13.860 
By then we will fully

125
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.710 
rebound membership wise

126
00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.988 
from the impacts of the

127
00:05:16.988 --> 00:05:19.006 
pandemic and the outcome

128
00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:20.015 
of membership

129
00:05:20.015 --> 00:05:21.933 
addings done in 2022.

130
00:05:24.523 --> 00:05:26.675 
The green line on this

131
00:05:26.675 --> 00:05:27.583 
line indicates

132
00:05:27.583 --> 00:05:28.761 
membership at the

133
00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.106 
beginning of the year,

134
00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:31.586 
while the orange line

135
00:05:31.586 --> 00:05:33.403 
indicates membership at

136
00:05:33.403 --> 00:05:34.647 
the end of the line.

137
00:05:34.647 --> 00:05:36.463 
The more significant the

138
00:05:36.463 --> 00:05:37.304 
gap between the

139
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:38.448 
beginning and ending

140
00:05:38.448 --> 00:05:39.962 
point, the higher the

141
00:05:39.962 --> 00:05:41.744 
increase each year in

142
00:05:41.744 --> 00:05:43.392 
our memberships.

143
00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.377 
On average, we have

144
00:05:45.377 --> 00:05:47.462 
had about 20,000 net

145
00:05:47.462 --> 00:05:48.909 
gains over the past 10

146
00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:50.422 
years, except for the

147
00:05:50.422 --> 00:05:53.046 
period of the pandemic.

148
00:05:53.416 --> 00:05:57.822 
Last year we had 30,620

149
00:05:57.822 --> 00:06:00.042 
baptisms and about

150
00:06:00.042 --> 00:06:01.960 
14,000 baptism for

151
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.171 
the first half of this

152
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:05.189 
year and we praise God

153
00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.250 
for every soul baptized.

154
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.537 
And we are projecting

155
00:06:10.537 --> 00:06:12.656 
that by the end of 2024,

156
00:06:12.656 --> 00:06:14.170 
we'll probably have more

157
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.760 
than 30,000 baptism

158
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.307 
at the minimum.

159
00:06:18.307 --> 00:06:19.619 
And it is my prayer,

160
00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:21.132 
it is my sincere prayer

161
00:06:21.132 --> 00:06:22.680 
that we may have more

162
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.169 
than 40,000 baptism

163
00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:26.918 
at the end of 2025.

164
00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:29.609 
Am I aiming too low?

165
00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:31.627 
I don't think so. 15,000

166
00:06:31.627 --> 00:06:33.410 
yes, yes.

167
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.452 
I think that God is

168
00:06:34.452 --> 00:06:35.394 
going to do a lot of

169
00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:36.538 
miracles among us

170
00:06:36.538 --> 00:06:37.110 
through the

171
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.691 
Pentecost 2025.

172
00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:42.626 
By the end of 2023,

173
00:06:42.626 --> 00:06:45.048 
we had more professions of

174
00:06:45.048 --> 00:06:46.965 
faiths than any previous

175
00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:50.026 
year going back to 2014,

176
00:06:50.026 --> 00:06:52.650 
probably is the residual

177
00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.139 
effect of the pandemic.

178
00:06:55.206 --> 00:06:56.686 
Let me briefly talk

179
00:06:56.686 --> 00:06:58.805 
about the transfers in

180
00:06:58.805 --> 00:07:00.251 
and out.

181
00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:01.496 
This group of peoples

182
00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:02.707 
moved their membership

183
00:07:02.707 --> 00:07:05.129 
into our division or to

184
00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:06.844 
another divisions in

185
00:07:06.844 --> 00:07:08.526 
2023.

186
00:07:08.526 --> 00:07:10.813 
More than 32,000 people

187
00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:12.663 
transferred in, while

188
00:07:12.663 --> 00:07:15.018 
about 30,000 members

189
00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:17.137 
transferred out.

190
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:19.290 
Quite a number of people

191
00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.467 
are coming in and then

192
00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:22.451 
transferring out, which

193
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:25.142 
is a net gain of 2,000.

194
00:07:25.142 --> 00:07:25.916 
Our church is a

195
00:07:25.916 --> 00:07:27.396 
worldwide church and our

196
00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:29.246 
membership system

197
00:07:29.246 --> 00:07:30.692 
works quite well with

198
00:07:30.692 --> 00:07:31.466 
the other sister

199
00:07:31.466 --> 00:07:32.408 
divisions.

200
00:07:32.408 --> 00:07:33.518 
They have their own

201
00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:34.695 
membership database

202
00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:36.108 
system and we have our

203
00:07:36.108 --> 00:07:38.092 
own and it works

204
00:07:38.092 --> 00:07:39.202 
perfectly fine between

205
00:07:39.202 --> 00:07:40.783 
ours, between us and

206
00:07:40.783 --> 00:07:42.869 
our sister divisions.

207
00:08:34.635 --> 00:08:35.913 
The history of mission

208
00:08:35.913 --> 00:08:37.124 
offerings in the 7th Day

209
00:08:37.124 --> 00:08:38.570 
Adventist Church is

210
00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.546 
rooted in the

211
00:08:39.546 --> 00:08:40.353 
denomination's

212
00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:42.035 
commitment to spreading

213
00:08:42.035 --> 00:08:44.087 
the gospel worldwide.

214
00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:45.365 
Historically, the North

215
00:08:45.365 --> 00:08:46.879 
American division has

216
00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:47.787 
been the largest

217
00:08:47.787 --> 00:08:48.964 
contributor to the

218
00:08:48.964 --> 00:08:49.939 
Adventist Church's

219
00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:51.487 
global mission work.

220
00:08:51.487 --> 00:08:53.303 
However, as other world

221
00:08:53.303 --> 00:08:54.716 
divisions have grown in

222
00:08:54.716 --> 00:08:56.061 
membership and financial

223
00:08:56.061 --> 00:08:58.046 
capacity, funding global

224
00:08:58.046 --> 00:08:59.324 
missions has become more

225
00:08:59.324 --> 00:09:01.308 
evenly distributed.

226
00:09:01.308 --> 00:09:02.856 
Nonetheless, the NAD

227
00:09:02.856 --> 00:09:04.672 
remains a key financial

228
00:09:04.672 --> 00:09:05.883 
supporter

229
00:09:05.883 --> 00:09:06.623 
of the churches

230
00:09:06.623 --> 00:09:09.650 
worldwide mission work.

231
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.727 
The 7th Day Adventist

232
00:09:10.727 --> 00:09:12.240 
Church systematically

233
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.115 
collects tithes and

234
00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:14.258 
offerings, with a

235
00:09:14.258 --> 00:09:15.671 
portion of these funds

236
00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:17.050 
allocated for mission

237
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:18.194 
work.

238
00:09:18.194 --> 00:09:20.044 
In 2001, the NAD's

239
00:09:20.044 --> 00:09:21.591 
tithe contribution was

240
00:09:21.591 --> 00:09:26.838 
$685,051,305, which

241
00:09:26.838 --> 00:09:29.395 
represented 61% of the

242
00:09:29.395 --> 00:09:30.404 
world total.

243
00:09:30.404 --> 00:09:32.758 
In the NAD's tithe

244
00:09:32.758 --> 00:09:34.104 
contribution was

245
00:09:34.104 --> 00:09:41.638 
$1,322,728,890.00,

246
00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:44.632 
which represented 42% of

247
00:09:44.632 --> 00:09:46.381 
the world total.

248
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:48.231 
In 2023, tithe per

249
00:09:48.231 --> 00:09:50.283 
capita in the NAD was in

250
00:09:50.283 --> 00:09:50.754 
U.S.

251
00:09:50.754 --> 00:09:53.377 
dollars 1,052, whereas

252
00:09:53.377 --> 00:09:54.824 
the tithe per capita for

253
00:09:54.824 --> 00:09:55.799 
the other divisions

254
00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:57.784 
combined was in U.S.

255
00:09:57.784 --> 00:09:59.970 
dollars $145

256
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:01.585 
Please note amounts from

257
00:10:01.585 --> 00:10:02.392 
world divisions

258
00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:03.805 
fluctuate with the

259
00:10:03.805 --> 00:10:05.386 
relative strength of the

260
00:10:05.386 --> 00:10:06.193 
various giving

261
00:10:06.193 --> 00:10:08.144 
currencies versus the US

262
00:10:08.144 --> 00:10:09.590 
dollar.

263
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.667 
The General Conference

264
00:10:10.667 --> 00:10:12.584 
uses tithe in many ways

265
00:10:12.584 --> 00:10:13.727 
to advance the mission

266
00:10:13.727 --> 00:10:14.804 
of the Church.

267
00:10:14.804 --> 00:10:16.553 
A partial list includes

268
00:10:16.553 --> 00:10:17.797 
mission awareness and

269
00:10:17.797 --> 00:10:18.840 
promotion,

270
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.186 
communication,

271
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.204 
education, various

272
00:10:22.204 --> 00:10:23.717 
niche ministries,

273
00:10:23.717 --> 00:10:24.861 
coordination,

274
00:10:24.861 --> 00:10:26.408 
consultation, and

275
00:10:26.408 --> 00:10:27.922 
leadership activities

276
00:10:27.922 --> 00:10:29.873 
for the world Church

277
00:10:29.873 --> 00:10:31.521 
through systematic ties

278
00:10:31.521 --> 00:10:33.203 
and offerings, special

279
00:10:33.203 --> 00:10:34.346 
initiatives, and

280
00:10:34.346 --> 00:10:35.356 
partnerships with the

281
00:10:35.356 --> 00:10:37.037 
General Conference.

282
00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:37.676 
The North American

283
00:10:37.676 --> 00:10:38.753 
division continues to

284
00:10:38.753 --> 00:10:40.805 
play a critical role.

285
00:10:40.805 --> 00:10:41.881 
And ensuring that

286
00:10:41.881 --> 00:10:43.596 
resources are available

287
00:10:43.596 --> 00:10:45.110 
to spread the Adventist

288
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.599 
message worldwide.

289
00:10:47.599 --> 00:10:51.064 
This is our story.

290
00:10:52.712 --> 00:10:54.495 
For the 2024 study,

291
00:10:54.495 --> 00:10:55.638 
we were only asking

292
00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:56.984 
about ethnicity, so

293
00:10:56.984 --> 00:10:58.127 
we opted to use

294
00:10:58.127 --> 00:10:59.574 
SurveyMonkey rather than

295
00:10:59.574 --> 00:11:01.390 
phone interviews, and

296
00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:02.635 
we were able to invite

297
00:11:02.635 --> 00:11:03.274 
every single

298
00:11:03.274 --> 00:11:04.384 
congregation in North

299
00:11:04.384 --> 00:11:05.931 
America.

300
00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.377 
Little over 2,100

301
00:11:07.377 --> 00:11:09.194 
responded.

302
00:11:09.194 --> 00:11:10.405 
And they provided data

303
00:11:10.405 --> 00:11:11.750 
for all but a few non

304
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:13.634 
attending members.

305
00:11:13.634 --> 00:11:14.441 
This shows the

306
00:11:14.441 --> 00:11:15.147 
percentage of

307
00:11:15.147 --> 00:11:16.459 
congregations in each

308
00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:17.905 
union that participated

309
00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:19.150 
in the survey.

310
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:20.226 
And you can see there's

311
00:11:20.226 --> 00:11:21.370 
a very even spread.

312
00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:22.985 
This shows the

313
00:11:22.985 --> 00:11:25.104 
percentage of ethnicity

314
00:11:25.104 --> 00:11:26.146 
of congregation that

315
00:11:26.146 --> 00:11:27.795 
participated in the

316
00:11:27.795 --> 00:11:28.232 
survey.

317
00:11:28.232 --> 00:11:30.519 
And again, very even

318
00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:31.865 
spread.

319
00:11:31.865 --> 00:11:33.008 
The green shows the

320
00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:34.522 
number of members in the

321
00:11:34.522 --> 00:11:35.464 
congregations that

322
00:11:35.464 --> 00:11:36.473 
participated in.

323
00:11:36.473 --> 00:11:37.482 
The yellow shows the

324
00:11:37.482 --> 00:11:38.457 
number of members that

325
00:11:38.457 --> 00:11:39.298 
they reported

326
00:11:39.298 --> 00:11:41.417 
In the survey and again

327
00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:42.729 
we see a very even

328
00:11:42.729 --> 00:11:44.209 
spread there.

329
00:11:44.209 --> 00:11:45.487 
I think it's safe to say

330
00:11:45.487 --> 00:11:46.765 
that it's true is the

331
00:11:46.765 --> 00:11:48.346 
Pew Research's statement

332
00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:50.230 
was in 2015, it's even

333
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.080 
truer today
