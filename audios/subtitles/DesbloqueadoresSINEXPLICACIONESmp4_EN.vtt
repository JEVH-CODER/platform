00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.500 
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.360 
Estos son unas frases que tú tienes que

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.160 
saber para que te puedan ayudar,
facilitar que tu expreses tus ideas, como

4
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.680 
para que tú puedas introducirlas y las
puedas desarrollar mucho más fácil.

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.800 
Entonces, vamos a la primera.

6
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.660 
A long time ago, a long time ago, I used

7
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.580 
to live in the city.

8
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.960 
Well, well, well, that is all I have to say.

9
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.500 
I would like to know.

10
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.040 
Well, I would like to know.

11
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.220 
Well, I would like to know if the project
is still on.

12
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.140 
I don't think that.

13
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.280 
I don't think that it is a good idea.

14
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.080 
That is to say, we should be more careful.

15
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.660 
I mean, it wasn't what we expected.

16
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.340 
I have an accident tomorrow.

17
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
I was going to do.

18
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.900 
I was going to do.

19
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
I was going to do the homework, but I

20
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.960 
fell asleep.

21
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.980 
I was going to do the homework, but I

22
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.500 
fell asleep.

23
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.920 
I was, I was.

24
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.620 
I was very shy when I was a child.

25
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
I didn't know.

26
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.520 
I didn't know.

27
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.960 
I didn't know there was another meeting today.

28
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.180 
Yesterday, I didn't want to.

29
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.820 
Yesterday, I didn't want to.

30
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.040 
Yesterday, I didn't want to go out
because it was raining.

31
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
So that it isn't.

32
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.360 
So that it isn't difficult, let's do it

33
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.400 
step by step.

34
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.820 
But what I wanted to say, pero lo que yo

35
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.800 
quería decir o lo que quería decir era
tal, tal cosa.

36
00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.000 
Ok, example.

37
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.280 
I want to know what you think about the project.

38
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.540 
Tell me what you need for tomorrow.

39
00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.540 
If I were Valeria, si yo fuera Valeria, I

40
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.440 
would take a break.

41
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.860 
Yo tomaría un descanso.

42
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.440 
If I were Valeria, I would take a break.

43
00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.520 
I want, I want, I want to learn how to

44
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.280 
play the guitar because I don't know how
to do it.

45
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.840 
I can't start because I don't know how to
do it.

46
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.140 
Because when, because when, because when
I study, I focus better.

47
00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.240 
I want to be better every day.

48
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.500 
Excuse me please, excuse me please,

49
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.040 
excuse me please, I need to get through
several times.

50
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
I've tried that several times.

51
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.740 
Many times, many times.

52
00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.360 
I've been to that place many times.

53
00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.240 
Sometimes, I go for a walk in the afternoon.

54
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:37.720 
Once in a while, once in a while, once in
a while, I like to read poetry.

55
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.580 
Some people, some people prefer coffee
without sugar.

56
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.040 
For example, for example, for example.

57
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.680 
I agree with your point of view.

58
00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:07.440 
I don't agree with that decision.

59
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.700 
Yes, of course.

60
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.020 
Do you want help?

61
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:15.520 
Yes, of course.

62
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.440 
I don't understand, I don't understand, I
don't understand, I don't understand how

63
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.420 
this works.

64
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:35.400 
What do you mean?

65
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.480 
What do you mean by that?

66
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.040 
What do you mean?

67
00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:47.520 
However, however, however, however, we
need another option.

68
00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.820 
Thank you.

69
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.420 
First of all, I want to thank you.

70
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.880 
I don't believe that, I don't believe
that, I don't believe that, I don't

71
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.060 
believe that is true.

72
00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.160 
I believe that, I believe that, I believe

73
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:16.260 
that, I believe that we can, I believe
that we can do it.

74
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:21.420 
What I meant, what I meant is you should
have more children.

75
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.960 
What do you want me to do?

76
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.100 
What do you want me to do?

77
00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:05.500 
You have to practice it in your spaced
repetition tool and also that you use it

78
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.880 
so that it can be recorded much easier
and that the brain has the neural

79
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:10.760 
connections it needs.

80
00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.760 
So that was all for these unlockers, this

81
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.580 
is how they are called, unlockers.

82
00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:18.760 
And remember that we are going to the

83
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:21.940 
next lesson after you see it a few times.
