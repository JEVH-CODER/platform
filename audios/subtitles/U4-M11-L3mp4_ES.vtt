1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.220 
So, what are you doing?

2
00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:03.620 
¿Qué estás haciendo?

3
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.220 
You're watching a video.

4
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.360 
¿Estás viendo un video?

5
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:13.840 
Now, let's jump right into it
. Let's watch this video.

6
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.760 
What are you doing?

7
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.740 
What are you doing?

8
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.100 
Oh, my goodness.

9
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.200 
Never, ever do that.

10
00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.360 
Nunca hagas eso.

11
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.480 
But the guy is asking there.

12
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.820 
Él está preguntando ahí.

13
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.980 
What are you doing?

14
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.520 
¿Qué estás haciendo?

15
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.440 
What are you doing?

16
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.980 
Dilo conmigo.

17
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.140 
What are you doing?

18
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.840 
Pretty good.

19
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.820 
What are you doing?

20
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.940 
¿Qué estás haciendo?

21
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.000 
Mira que el in le da eso de endo, ando.

22
00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.360 
All right?

23
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.500 
For example, over here, en esta frase de aquí.

24
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.820 
We're cooking lunch with some friends.

25
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.580 
Estamos cocinando el almuerzo con algunos amigos.

26
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.640 
Say with me.

27
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.460 
We're cooking lunch with some friends.

28
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.020 
Pretty good.

29
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.880 
Once more.

30
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.660 
We're cooking lunch with some friends.

31
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.240 
That's great.

32
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.620 
That's great.

33
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.840 
You could also say, I like to cook.

34
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.420 
Me gusta cocinar.

35
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.380 
Now, that way, it's okay.

36
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.280 
Está bien, pero no suena tan nativo.

37
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.660 
All right?

38
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.300 
So, para que suene más nativo, utilizamos
el ing.

39
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.700 
¿Cómo?

40
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
Mira.

41
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.460 
Así como aparece aquí.

42
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.660 
I like cooking.

43
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.120 
Me gusta cocinar.

44
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.720 
I like cooking.

45
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:19.580 
Dilo conmigo.

46
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.060 
I like cooking.

47
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.500 
Pretty good.

48
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.480 
Con ese ing, en vez de to, pones ing.

49
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.840 
All right?

50
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.340 
I like to cook.

51
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.540 
Se convierte en I like cooking.

52
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.840 
Pretty good.

53
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.280 
Now, let's check another phrase over here
is to make a house a home.

54
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.080 
Hacer de una casa un hogar.

55
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.060 
You know, a house es más el edificio.

56
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.880 
Esto te va a quedar claro una vez para
que diferencies house y home.

57
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.620 
House es más el edificio.

58
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.200 
La pared.

59
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.580 
All right?

60
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.740 
That is a house.

61
00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.020 
Esta es una casa.

62
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.700 
Okay?

63
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.820 
And a home es más como un hogar.

64
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.660 
Las personas que viven en ella.

65
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.660 
The brother, the sister, the father, the mom.

66
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.400 
All right?

67
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.040 
You know, parents and kids.

68
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.680 
Eso es más la home.

69
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:00.600 
El hogar.

70
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
So, to make a house a home es como crear

71
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.980 
un hogar dentro de una casa.

72
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
All right?

73
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.020 
Tener un hogar dentro de esa casa.

74
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.700 
Dilo conmigo.

75
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.000 
To make a house a home.

76
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.560 
Pretty good.

77
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.240 
Once more.

78
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.320 
To make a house a home.

79
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.240 
That's excellent.

80
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.800 
Excellent.

81
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.860 
Next up we got, I've made dinner for us.

82
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:24.940 
All right?

83
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.860 
I've made dinner for us.

84
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.480 
Nos he hecho la cena.

85
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.920 
Now, what about you doing dinner for
everybody today?

86
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.560 
¿Qué piensas de hacer la cena para todos hoy?

87
00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:35.400 
Think about it.

88
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.860 
Si te animas, dale.

89
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.160 
Y cuando lo hagas, diles a todos.

90
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.520 
I've made dinner for us.

91
00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.700 
He hecho la cena para nosotros.

92
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.380 
Okay?

93
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.780 
I've made dinner.

94
00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.420 
Hice la cena.

95
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.140 
I've made dinner.

96
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.780 
Dilo conmigo.

97
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.600 
I've made dinner for us.

98
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.600 
Pretty good.

99
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.140 
That's awesome.

100
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.200 
Now, we have, they're making dinner in
the kitchen.

101
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.380 
Ellos están haciendo la cena en la cocina.

102
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.220 
Dilo conmigo.

103
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.940 
They're making dinner in the kitchen.

104
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.660 
Pretty good.

105
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.360 
That's awesome.

106
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.960 
Once more.

107
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.080 
They're making dinner in the kitchen.

108
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.680 
That's right.

109
00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.140 
That's right.

110
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.420 
Now, making sería entonces haciendo.

111
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.480 
All right?

112
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
Make.

113
00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.060 
Make.

114
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.300 
De hacer.

115
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.380 
Making.

116
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.920 
Haciendo.

117
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.780 
Now, we have over here.

118
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.440 
Let's check out this video.

119
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.720 
I'm going home.

120
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.040 
I'm going home right now.

121
00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.360 
I'm going home.

122
00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.640 
I'm going home right now.

123
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.920 
I'm going home.

124
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.440 
I'm going home right now.

125
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.840 
All right?

126
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.480 
She's saying, I'm going home.

127
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.480 
Está diciendo, me voy para la casa.

128
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.280 
Okay?

129
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.340 
Voy a casa.

130
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.960 
Dilo conmigo.

131
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.900 
I'm going home.

132
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:42.360 
Pretty good.

133
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.120 
Once more.

134
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.860 
I'm going home.

135
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:46.580 
That's right.

136
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.220 
I'm going significa que voy a ir o estoy

137
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.600 
yendo a.

138
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.780 
For example, I'm going to work.

139
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.360 
See you later.

140
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.200 
Voy a trabajar.

141
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.260 
Nos vemos luego.

142
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.840 
Okay?

143
00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.560 
Most of you may drive.

144
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.460 
And you know, so you can commute to your work.

145
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.660 
So you can work.

146
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.760 
Work.

147
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.800 
La mayoría de las personas drive,
conducen para ir al trabajo.

148
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.240 
So you could say, I'm going to work.

149
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.340 
See you later.

150
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.220 
Voy a trabajar.

151
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.900 
Nos vemos luego.

152
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.540 
Dilo conmigo.

153
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.540 
I'm going to work.

154
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.790 
See you later.

155
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.290 
All right.

156
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.290 
But some people, like this guy over here,
have the privilege of working from home.

157
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:25.410 
Hay algunas personas como este señor que
tienen el privilegio de trabajar desde la casa.

158
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.070 
Now, of course, I guess people don't
worry about that.

159
00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.530 
Obviamente, sé que muchos no trabajamos
desde la casa de esa forma.

160
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.090 
But, all right.

161
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.470 
Let's check out this phrase.

162
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.330 
Tom is working from home today.

163
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.070 
Tom trabaja hoy desde casa.

164
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.310 
All right?

165
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.050 
O Tom hoy trabaja desde casa.

166
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.610 
Se puede decir de ambas formas.

167
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.990 
Tom is working from home today.

168
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.810 
Dilo conmigo.

169
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.430 
Tom is working from home today.

170
00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.030 
That's great.

171
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.430 
That's great.

172
00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:58.090 
Now, does your company let you work from home?

173
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.950 
Tu empresa te deja trabajar desde la casa.

174
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.210 
Write it in the comments below.

175
00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.710 
Escribe allá abajo en los comentarios.

176
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.850 
Does your company let you work from home?

177
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.350 
Pretty good now.

178
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.930 
This girl over here.

179
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.010 
Oh, she's like saying.

180
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.490 
Ella está como diciendo.

181
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.290 
I'm tired.

182
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.550 
I'm going to bed now.

183
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.790 
Estoy cansada.

184
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.950 
Voy a la cama.

185
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.330 
Voy a dormir ahora.

186
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
So, dilo conmigo.

187
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.270 
I'm tired.

I'm going to bed now.

189
00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.010

Eso significa que estás cansado de que
vas a la cama.

195
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.370

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.450 
Excellent.

Eso significa me estoy quedando en casa.

206
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.150
