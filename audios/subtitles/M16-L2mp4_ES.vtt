Hi, hi there.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:04.820 
Welcome.

3
00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.560 
Today we're going to learn how can you
talk about the past.

4
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.040 
Vamos a ver cómo puedes hablar sobre el pasado.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
So, have this in mind.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.780 
Ten esto en la mente.

7
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.640 
Siempre que quieras hablar del pasado,

8
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.000 
por ejemplo, que él estuvo en
kindergarten, que él estaba en el jardín

9
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.100 
de infancia, por ejemplo.

10
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.380 
He was a kindergarten.

11
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.880 
He was.

12
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.300 
Okay?

13
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.440 
He was.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.240

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.980 
Pretty good.

17
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.420 
So, cada vez que vayas a hablar de una
sola persona, dices was.

18
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.860 
Si vas a hablar de varias personas, dices where.

19
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.540 
Okay?

20
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.740 
Si vas a hablar de una sola, dices was.

21
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.480 
Si vas a hablar de varias personas, dices where.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.670 
Nice.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.430 
It was the worst call I've ever received.

54
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
It was the worst call I've ever received.

55

Now, she wasn't home.

61
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.510 
She wasn't home.

62
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:09.810 
Ella no estaba en la casa.

63
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.190 
She wasn't home.

64
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.710 
You?

65
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.260 
Pretty good.

66
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.720 
Nice.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.650 
So, si viste, si te viste cuenta, todos
los de atrás eran una sola persona, ¿listo?

75
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.150 
O un solo objeto, entonces siempre usamos was.

76
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.990 
Ahorita vamos a ver un plural de varias personas.

77
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.010 
They were all gathered around something.

78
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.610 
They were all gathered around something.

79
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.150 
Ellos todos estaban reunidos alrededor de algo.

80
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.310 
So, they were all gathered around something.

81
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.640 
You, pretty good, excellent.

82
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.280 
They were all gathered around something.

83
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.820 
Pretty good, nice, nice.

84
00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.280 
We were just three minutes too late.

85
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.580 
Solo estábamos tres minutos demasiado tarde.

86
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.020 
O sea, que llegaron tres minutos

87
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:14.000 
demasiado tarde.

88
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.000 
We were just three minutes too late.

89
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.430 
You, pretty good, nice, nice.

90
00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.610 
She was dead.

91
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.830 
She was dead.

92
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.850 
She was dead.

93
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.910 
Estaba muerta.

94
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.990 
She was dead.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.780 
Again, she was dead.

96
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:37.880 
Really good, excellent, excellent.

97
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.400 
Now, what would you do if you were in
that situation?

98
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.300 
What would you do if you were in that situation?

99
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.400 
¿Qué harías tú si estuvieras en una

100
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.780 
situación como la de la historia?

101
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.500 
So, check out the story.

102
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.500 
Mira la historia.

103
00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.600 
I was going to work as usual.

104
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.180 
My wife, Anna, was pregnant and our son,
Mike, was really excited about his future sister.

105
00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.040 
After work, I went to pick Mike up.

106
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.620 
He was at kindergarten when I received a call.

107
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.440 
It was the worst call I've ever received.

108
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.660 
Mr. Robinson, please come as soon as possible.

109
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.800 
I called home to talk to my wife, Anna.

110
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.180 
She wasn't home when I called, so I

111
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.000 
called her phone.

112
00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.820 
Some police officers answered and asked

113
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:20.500 
me to meet them.

114
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.540 
Had Anna committed a crime?

115
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.100 
No.

116
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.540 
I knew my Anna.

117
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.580 
She's an angel.

118
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.700 
When I got there, I saw a lot of people,

119
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.600 
the police and the ambulance.

120
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.200 
They were all gathered around something,

121
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:33.600 
my Anna's body.

122
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.080 
She was run over by a drunk man while

123
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.060 
crossing the street.

124
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.180 
It was a really shocking moment.

125
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.380 
Mike was screaming and I didn't know how
to calm him down.

126
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.420 
The police told me they were called by
the community when the drunk man fled and

127
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.980 
that my wife took her last breath three
minutes before we arrived.

128
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.500 
We were three minutes late.

129
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.740 
We were just three minutes too late.

130
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:57.180 
But nothing could bring my wife back.

131
00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.480 
She was dead.

132
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.860 
The man was caught and sentenced to 30
years in jail.

133
00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.560 
Amazingly, the baby survived.

134
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:05.760 
She's five now.

135
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:06.960 
Her name is Miracle.

136
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.080 
She was a miracle.

137
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.590 
For today, congratulations.

138
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.270 
So, the achievement work, 38 words, 38

139

140
00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:27.190
