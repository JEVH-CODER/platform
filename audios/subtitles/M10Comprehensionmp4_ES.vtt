Number one, Carson used to dream of

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.960 
becoming a neurosurgeon and his hard work
eventually paid off.

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.440 
Now, you must know that entering the
field of neurosurgery is known for being

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.700 
an extremely rigorous process.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.020 
Now, my question is, what was Carson's

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.160 
dream and how challenging is the process
to achieve it?

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.780 
Number two, one of his most notable
achievements was performing the first

10
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
successful separation of conjoined twins
who were joined at the back of the head.

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.040 
What is one of Ben Carson's most famous
medical achievements?

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.480 
And number three, despite all these
challenges, despite all these challenges,

13
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.460 
Dr. Ben Carson became renowned for his
skill and position during his career as a neurosurgeon.

14
00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.500 
And also, he looked after his patients
with great care, often putting off his

15
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.500 
own comfort.

16
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.460 
So, how did Ben Carson balance his

17
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.420 
medical skill with patient care?

18
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.220 
Alright, I look forward to your comments

19
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.880 
in the section.

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.080 
Let's go.

21
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
Let's go.

22
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.360 
Let's go.
