6
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.960 
Once upon a time, there was a man who had

7
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:17.620 
two sons.

8
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.660 
The younger of the two sons said to his

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.560 
father, Father, give me my share of the
estate now.

10
00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.700 
The father, who was generous in
understanding, agreed and divided his

11
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.280 
wealth between his two sons.

12
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.540 
Both sons received a share of the estate.

13
00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.040 
The younger son, who wanted to explore
the world, took his share of the estate

14
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.600 
and went to a distant country.

15
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.060 
There, he spent all his money on reckless

16
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.020 
living, enjoying the pleasures of life
without thinking about the future.

17
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.540 
He wasted his inheritance on lavish
purchases, which he could not afford if

18
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.680 
he wanted to live long.

19
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.900 
After he had spent everything, a severe

20
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.560 
famine arose in that country.

21
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.800 
The younger son found himself in need.

22
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.860 
He started to work for a citizen of that
country, who sent him to feed pigs.

23
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.660 
He was so desperate that he would have
gladly eaten the food that the pigs were

24
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.920 
eating, but no one gave him anything.

25
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.420 
In his misery, the younger son came to

26
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.980 
his senses.

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.860 
He thought, I've got to return home.

28
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.660 
How many of my father's hired servants
have food to spare

29
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.940 
, and here I am starving to death
.

30
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.540 
I will go back to my father and say to
him, Father, I have sinned against heaven

31
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.020 
and against you.

32
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.760 
I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

33
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.700 
Make me like one of your hired servants.

34
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.580 
So he got up and went to his father.

35
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.200 
While he was still a long way off, his
father saw him and was filled with compassion.

36
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.240 
He ran to his son, embraced him, and
kissed him.

37
00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.360 
The son said to his father, Father, I
have sinned against heaven and against you.

38
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.680 
I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

39
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.980 
But the father said to his servants, Quick!

40
00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.660 
Bring the best robe and put it on him.

41
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.620 
Put a ring on his finger and sandals on

42
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.960 
his feet.

43
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.580 
Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

44
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.260 
Let's have a feast and celebrate
.

45
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.000 
For this son of mine was dead and is
alive again.

46
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.400 
He was lost and is found.

47
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.460 
So they began to celebrate.

48
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.180 
Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.

49
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.760 
When he came near the house, he heard

50
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.480 
music and dancing.

51
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.520 
He called one of the servants and asked,

52
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.560 
What's going on?

53
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.380 
The servant replied, Your brother has

54
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.480 
come home, and your father has killed the
fattened calf because he has him back

55
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.240 
safe and sound.

56
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.100 
The older brother became angry and

57
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
refused to go in.

58
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.020 
So his father went out and pleaded with

59
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.600 
him, Look!

60
00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.360 
All these years I have been slaving for

61
00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.160 
you and never disobeyed your orders
.

62
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.460 
Yet you never gave me even a young goat
so I could celebrate with my friends.

63
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.800 
But when this son of yours, who has
squandered your property with prostitutes,

64
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.660 
comes home, you kill the fattened calf
for him.

65
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.800 
I'm much better than he is.

66
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.440 
I've been the most obedient child you've had.

67
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.020 
The father replied, My son, you are
always with me, and everything I have is yours.

68
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.000 
This time we had to celebrate and be
glad, because this brother of yours was

69
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.420 
dead and is alive again.

70
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.800 
He was lost and now is found.

71
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.020 
And you know I love you both equally,
don't you?

72
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.000 
Well, perhaps, said the oldest son.

73
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.280 
So always remember that, I love you both

74
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.640 
equally, said the father.

75
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.680 
So always remember, take this ride.

76
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.840 
On the other side, Come on look.
