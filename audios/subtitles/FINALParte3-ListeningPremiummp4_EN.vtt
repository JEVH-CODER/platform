00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.060 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.680 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.880 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.140 
We'll also learn about contractions.

6
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.380 
Let's get started.

7
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.300 
Elision.

8
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.240 
Sometimes sounds are dropped when we
speak quickly.

9
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.140 
Examples.

10
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.500 
I'm going to go to the doctor's tomorrow.

11
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.780

12
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.640 
He shoulda gone to the store.

13
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.880 
He shoulda.

14
00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.700 
I woulda gone if I had known.

15
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:28.940 
I woulda.

16
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.680 
You coulda told me earlier.

17
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.120 
You coulda.

18
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.100 
She musta missed the train.

19
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.380 
She musta.

20
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.840 
We mighta been late.

21
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.960 
We mighta.

22
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.820 
Gimme a call when you arrive.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.640 
Lemme know if you need anything.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.840

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.480

Wanna.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.480 
I gotta finish this today.

29
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
Gotta.

30
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.460 
It's kind of funny how that happened.

31
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.300 
Kinda.

32
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.260 
I ran out of milk.

33
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.280 
Outta.

34
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.580 
I need a cup of tea.

35
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
Cuppa.

36
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.100 
That's a lot of work.

37
00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.960 
Lotta.

38
00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.440

39
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:02.560

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.060 
I don't know what to do.

41
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.980 
D 'know.

42
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.120 
Assimilation.

43
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.960 
When two sounds are next to each other,
one may change to sound more like the other.

44
00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.860 
Examples.

45
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.300 
You have to gone -o because it's late.

46
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.800 
You have to go.

47
00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.460 
Have to pick up the groceries.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.480 
Hafta.

49
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.840 
Wanna eat out tonight?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.740 
Wanna.

51
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.500 
Could you help me with this?

52
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.680 
Could you?

53
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.180 
Would you come with me?

54
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.220 
Would you?

55
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.980 
Did you see that movie?

56
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.760 
Did you?

57
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.600 
This shop has great deals.

58
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.120 
This shop.

59
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.900 
That boy is very tall.

60
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.040 
That boy.

61
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
In Paris right now.

62
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.020 
In Paris.

63
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.020 
Last year was amazing.

64
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.400 
Last year.

65
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:42.820 
Good girl did well.

66
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.220 
Good girl.

67
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.360 
Green bag is on the table.

68
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.300 
Green card.

69
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.900 
Tum cards are missing.

70
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.240 
Tum cards.

71
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.260 
Linking.

72
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.780 
Sounds from one word can connect with the
next word.

73
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.640 
Examples.

74
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.760 
Let's go on a trip this weekend.

75
00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.920

76
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.840 
Let's go on a trip next month.

77
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.840 
Go on.

78
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.040 
Do it yourself.

79
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.640 
Do it.

80
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.840 
How are you doing?

81
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.080

See it.

84
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.940 
Get up and get moving.

85
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.920 
Get up.

86
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.160 
Turn off the lights.

87
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.520 
Turn off.

88
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.680 
Put it over there.

89
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.780 
Put it.

90
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.040 
Bring it to the meeting.

91
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.020 
Bring it.

92
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.240 
Call up your friend.

93
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.260 
Call up.

94
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.640 
Find out what happened.

95
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.660 
Find out.

96
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.820 
Get out of the car.

97
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.060 
Get out.

98
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.620 
Hold on for a second.

99
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.700 
Hold on.

100
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.920 
Turn it off please.

101
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.100 
Turn it.

102
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.840 
Reduction.

103
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:37.880 
Some sounds become weaker or change to
the schwa vowel, which sounds like, uh, examples.

104
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.540 
Can you help me with this problem?

105
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.860 
Can you help me?

106
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.820 
Can you come here?

107
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.860 
Can you?

108
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.540 
They need help?

109
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.440 
D 'ya.

110
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.880 
What do you think about this?

111
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.800 
What do you?

112
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.000 
I'm going to the store.

113
00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.000 
I'm.

114
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.200 
He's always late.

115
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.160 
He's.

116
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.020 
She's coming over later.

117
00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:54.160 
She's.

118
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.700 
They're not here yet.

119
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.360 
They're.

120
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.820 
We're going on vacation.

121
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.780 
We're.

122
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.020 
You're the best.

123
00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.840 
You're.

124
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
It's going to rain.

125
00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.040 
It's.

126
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.580 
There's a problem with the car.

127
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.700 
There's.

128
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.340 
Where's the nearest station?

129
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:08.460 
Where's.

130
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.940 
Who's coming to the party?

131
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.920 
Who's.

132
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.120 
Contractions.

133
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.380 
Contractions occur when we combine two

134
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.020 
words to make a shorter form.

135
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.800 
Examples.

136
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.640 
I'm going to the store now.

137
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.660 
I'm going.

138
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:20.960 
I'm going to the store.

139
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.320 
I'm.

140
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.880 
You're invited to the party.

141
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.620 
You're.

142
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.120 
He's already finished.

143
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:27.140 
He's.

144
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.560 
She's leaving soon.

145
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.540 
She's.

146
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.060 
It's a beautiful day.

147
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.060 
It's.

148
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:33.680 
We're having a great time.

149
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.520 
We're.

150
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.780 
They're going to be late.

151
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.420 
There.

152
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.820 
I'll see you later.

153
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.980 
I'll.

154
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.160 
You'll do great.

155
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:41.020 
You'll.

156
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.680 
He'll join us later.

157
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.700 
He'll.

158
00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.240 
She'll be here soon.

159
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.180 
She'll.

160
00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.340 
It'll be fun.

161
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:48.200 
It'll.

162
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.540 
We'll meet at noon.

163
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.640 
We'll.

164
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.200 
They'll arrive tomorrow.

165
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.060 
They'll.

166
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.720 
I've finished my homework.

167
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.440 
I've.

168
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.620 
You've got to see this.

169
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.540 
You've.

170
00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.040 
He's finished his work.

171
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.960 
He's.

172
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:01.680 
She's already left.

173
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.740 
She's.

174
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.660 
It's worked well for years.

175
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.780 
It's.

176
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
We've been waiting.

177
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.080 
We've.

178
00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.400 
They've got the tickets.

179
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.680 
They've.

180
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.120 
I'd love to go.

181
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.760 
I'd.

182
00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.020 
You'd better hurry.

183
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.000 
You'd.

184
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.620 
He'd.

185
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.460 
He'd like some coffee.

186
00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.360 
He'd.

187
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.980 
She'd appreciate your help.

188
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.960 
She'd.

189
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.440 
It'd be nice to meet her.

190
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.420 
It'd.

191
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.000 
We'd be happy to help.

192
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.840 
We'd.

193
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.480 
They'd prefer a different time.

194
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.720 
They'd.

195
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.300 
I'd finish by then.

196
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.160 
I'd.

197
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.920 
You'd have loved the show.

198
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:33.080 
You'd.

199
00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.840 
He'd been waiting for hours.

200
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.780 
He'd.

201
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.380 
She'd gone home early.

202
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.360 
She'd.

203
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.980 
It'd been a long day.

204
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.840 
It'd.

205
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.620 
We'd seen that movie before.

206
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.800 
We'd.

207
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.240 
They'd already left.

208
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:46.080 
They'd.
