00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080 
In Climate Watch, the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration has

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.900 
released its State of the Climate report
for August.

3
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.540 
The data shows that this summer was more
than two degrees above normal, making it

4
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
one of the warmest ever on record.

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.880 
The report also found the amount of

6
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.820 
climate disasters that occurred in the
United States this summer was abnormal.

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.440 
For more, I want to bring in CBS News
Meteorologist and Climate Specialist,

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.240 
Jeff Berardelli.

9
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.840 
Jeff, the report says this summer is tied

10
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.840 
with a Dust Bowl summer of 1936.

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.300 
How significant is that?

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.780 
Very significant.

13
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.420 
That was an extraordinarily hot summer

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.500 
and it was man -made.

15
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.620 
The reason why it was so hot was caused

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.180 
by humans.

17
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
Farmers had gotten rid of all the native

18
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.180 
grass because a lot of the farmers that
were moving into that area during that

19
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.540 
time didn't have a lot of experience farming.

20
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.660 
So they wiped out all the native grass

21
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.300 
and just left dirt behind.

22
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.080 
And that dirt would absorb a lot of the

23
00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.300 
sun's rays and really, really heat it up.

24
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.040 
And also, it created tremendous dust

25
00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.760 
storms, which in many cases were deadly
dust storms.
