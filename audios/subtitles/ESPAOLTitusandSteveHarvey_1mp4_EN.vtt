00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.540 
Grab a seat man.

2
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.140 
That's my seat.

3
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.600 
That's that's my seat.

4
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
Pretty good.

5
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:41.600 
You're four years old?

6
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.400 
I had to think about it a little bit.

7
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.500 
Titus, let me ask you a question.

8
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.780 
Do you know that you have over 50 million

9
00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.120 
views on YouTube?

10
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.010 
There's already over a hundred.

11
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.670 
Okay, you have over...

12
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
But what does that say?

13
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.170 
It's all this is wrong.

14
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.150 
All this is wrong.

15
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.450 
Because it says you have over 50 million viewers.

16
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.870 
You have cleaned it up.

17
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.390 
You have over a hundred million.

18
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.760 
But I...

19
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.680 
Why is it three girls in those spots?

20
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.080 
Because in this show, we put hot chicks

21
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.120 
on the front row.

22
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.250 
But see, we got your dad.

23
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.950 
See, that's your dad over there, right?

24
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.630 
I know.

25
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.070 
I know, but see, that's the dad and
that's the dad seat over there.

26
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.390 
Because we put him there.

27
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.160 
Put eyes there, so then here.

28
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.080 
Right.

29
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.460 
So he can see you better.

30
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.200 
All right, I'll tell you what.

31
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.660 
I got some balls over here, and I want

32
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.880 
you to...

33
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.580 
And over there.

34
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:17.320 
And...

35
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.920 
Okay, I didn't know that.

36
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.560 
I just saw the ones over here.

37
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.280 
So, where are your balls?

38
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.860 
Okay.

39
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.520 
Let's go see a couple of tricks.

40
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.240 
Let's go over here first.

41
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.680 
Yeah.

42
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.560 
Okay.

43
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.860 
All right, let me see this first one.

44
00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:51.660 
I can make it up here.

45
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.340 
Okay, well, let me put you up there then.

46
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.460 
I'm gonna put you up there.

47
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.940 
Hold on.

48
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.620 
And let me see.

49
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.160 
Let me get a couple of balls, because we

50
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.380 
might need a few shots at this.

51
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:00.940 
But you're gonna make it.

52
00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.320 
So, what's your first one?

53
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.760 
You're just gonna do it, ladies and gentlemen.

54
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.160 
Titus the Magnificent.

55
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.460 
Yes, you can do it now.

56
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.010 
Okay, go ahead.

57
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.570 
What?

58
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.530 
Just help make one, buddy, so we can go down.

59
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.800 
Yeah.

60
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.580 
Titus?

61
00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.820 
Titus, don't worry about the smoke.

62
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:03.900 
Let's just make this shot.

63
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.980 
So, what we're gonna do now is...

64
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.680 
Titus, you're scaring me with the smoke.

65
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.260 
Just...

66
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.060 
Yeah, the smoke is gone.

67
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.380 
Okay, you ready?

68
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.340 
Are you lined up where you need...

69
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:20.260 
Is this thing moving?

70
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.560 
Okay, here's my shot.

71
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.560 
Okay, there it is.

72
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.940 
All right, Titus, let's go.
