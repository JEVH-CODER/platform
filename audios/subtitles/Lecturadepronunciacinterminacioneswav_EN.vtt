00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.060 
Sam woke up early to help his mother with breakfast.

2
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:07.500 
Are you feeling in good health today? she asked.

3
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.520 
He nodded, though he felt a bit hot.

4
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.120 
After breakfast, he said.

5
00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.620 
I'll pack my bag and go for a run.

6
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.580 
It's important to stay fit, not fat.

7
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.700 
As he ran, Sam noticed the changing weather.

8
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.040 
There was a chance of rain or even hail,

9
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.980 
but he thought.

10
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.780 
I'll keep going.

11
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.180 
He saw a hen in the sand by the path and
a bird in the air, singing a song that

12
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.320 
made him feel happy.

13
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.760 
Sam stopped by the river, where he saw a

14
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.060 
man build a small boat.

15
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.720 
I've built many boats like this, the man said.

16
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.560 
Sam admired his strength and faith in his craft.

17
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.100 
Later, at school, the teacher said.

18
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.680 
Think about what makes life worth living.

19
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.760 
Is it truth, wealth, or growth?

20
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.540 
Sam raised his hand and said.

21
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.420 
For me, it's my brother, my father, and

22
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.940 
my mother.

23
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.760 
They're always there, no matter the month

24
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.500 
or the weather.

25
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.240 
In class, they read about the Earth's

26
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.920 
history and the death and birth of civilizations.

27
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.580 
Sam learned how strength and

28
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.640 
determination can change the world.

29
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.200 
After school, he met his friends and said.

30
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.560 
Hey, let's play soccer.

31
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:24.560 
They all agreed.

32
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.600 
Who will be the goalkeeper?

33
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.600 
Someone asked.

34
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.120 
I will, Sam said.

35
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.400 
He held his position well, showing his

36
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.360 
quick reflexes and strong faith in his team.

37
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
That evening, at dinner, Sam's mother asked.

38
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
What did you learn today?

39
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.260 
He replied.

40
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.200 
We learned about the truth of the world
and how important it is to work together

41
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.500 
to make it a better place.
