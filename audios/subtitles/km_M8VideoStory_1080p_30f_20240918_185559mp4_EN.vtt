00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.680
Once Upon a time there was a man who had two sons.

5
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.560
The younger of the two sons said to his father,
Father, give me my share of the estate now.

6
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.040
The father, who was generous in understanding,
agreed and divided his wealth between his two sons.

7
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:38.420
Both sons received a share of the estate.
The younger son, who wanted to explore the world,

8
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.820
took his share of the estate and went to a distant country.
There, he spent all his money on reckless living,

9
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
enjoying the pleasures of life without thinking about the
future.

10
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.260
He wasted his inheritance on lavish purchases,
which he could not afford if he wanted to live long.

11
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.360
After he had spent everything, a severe famine
arose in that country.

12
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.160
The younger son found himself in need.
He started to work for a citizen of that country,

13
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.280
who sent him to feed pigs.
He was so desperate that he would have gladly eaten the

14
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.800
food that the pigs were eating, but no one gave
him anything.

15
00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.830
In his misery, the younger son came to his senses.
He thought, I've got to return home.

16
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.710
How many of my father's hired servants have food to spare?
And here I am starving to death.

17
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.910
I will go back to my father and say to him, Father,
I have sinned against heaven and against you.

18
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.200
I am no longer worthy to be called your son.
Make me like one of your hired servants.

19
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.040
So he got up and went to his father while he was still a
long way off.

20
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.760
His father saw him and was filled with compassion.

21
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:58.660
He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.
The son said to his father, Father, I have sinned

22
00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.420
against heaven and against you.
I am no longer worthy to be called your son.

23
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.340
But the Father said to his servants, Quick, bring
the best robe and put it on him.

24
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.160
Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

25
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.120
Let's have a feast and celebrate, for this son
of mine was dead and is alive again.

26
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.630
He was lost and is found.

27
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.630
So they began to celebrate.
Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.

28
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.790
When he came near the house, he heard music and
dancing.

29
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.070
He called one of the servants and asked what's going on?
The servant replied, Your brother has come home

30
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.430
and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has
him back safe and sound.

31
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.320
The older brother became angry and refused to go in.

32
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.480
So his father went out and pleaded with him.

33
00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.390
Look, all these years I have been slaving for
you and never disobeyed your orders.

34
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.750
You never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate
with my friends.

35
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.310
But when this son of yours who has squandered your property
with prostitutes comes home, you kill the fattened

36
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.110
calf for him.
I'm much better than he is.

37
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.200
I've been the most obedient child you've had,
the father replied.

38
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.160
My son, you are always with me and everything
I have is yours.

39
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.630
This time we had to celebrate and be glad because this
brother of yours was dead and is alive again.

40
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.590
He was lost and now is found.
And you know I love you both equally, don't you?

41
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:44.470
Well, perhaps, said the oldest son.
So always remember that I love you both equally,

42
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.350
said the father.
