00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000 
Good evening.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000 
We're going to start with breaking news from a quiet suburban area

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000 
where a tragic accident has just happened.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000 
A man, reported to be drunk,

8
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000 
was driving alone in his car when he crashed into a tree.

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000 
The impact was severe

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000 
and the man was thrown through the air,

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000 
falling 500 meters from the crash site.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000 
He landed under a bridge that also serves as a main road.

13
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000 
When emergency services arrived to retrieve the body,

14
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000 
they were shocked to find, right in front of them, not one,

15
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000 
but two bodies at the scene.

16
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
Our reporter Dayana went to that tragic place and she's there now.

17
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000 
Please, Dayana, tell us more about it.

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000 
That's right!

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000 
Authorities have confirmed that one of the bodies is indeed the driver of the car.

20
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000 
However, the second body, which was found next to it,

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000 
was just discovered though the second person had been deceased for a couple of days

22
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000 
before being found and their identity remains unknown.

23
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000 
Many are wondering, whose body is this?

24
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000 
There are speculations that this individual might be someone involved

25
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000 
in the criminal activities reported around this bridge.

26
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000 
Neighbors of race concerns that the bridge has become a hideout

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000 
for thieves and drug addicts who caused much harm.

28
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000 
With everything they did, they made this place dangerous.

29
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000 
They said they think it's most likely

30
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000 
that the unidentified body belongs to one of those criminals

31
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000 
and many people say that it is not worth investigating or closing the road.

32
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000 
However, a few people supported by a human rights organization

33
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000 
say they'll go and follow complaint about such an act of intolerance

34
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000 
and savagery by the neighbors.

35
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
There is a lot of confusion yet little is known.

36
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000 
You continue on Studio Carla.

37
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
Sure, in an attempt to understand the situation better,

38
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000 
authorities are investigating further.

39
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000 
They want to determine if there is a connection between the two deaths

40
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000 
and what exactly led to this tragic series of events.

41
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000 
They have stated that it's too early to draw any conclusions

42
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000 
and they assure the public that they will do their job and make this case clear.
