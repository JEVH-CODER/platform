00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.340 
Hi, hi there.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.620 
Welcome to this lesson.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.020 
For today, we're going to watch a little
bit more about work, okay?

4
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.060 
And this is going to be a little bit more specific.

5
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.140 
Va a ser algo de trabajo un poco más específico.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
The first phrase we're going to watch is,
or we're going to study is, do you work

7
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.780 
in finances?

8
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.040 
Okay, do you work in finances?

9
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.600 
¿Trabajas en finanzas?

10
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.120 
Do you work in finances?

11
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.180 
So, do you work, recuerda que el do you
es siempre que le vas a preguntar a otra

12
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.520 
persona si hace algo.

13
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.140 
Entonces, do you work in finances?

14
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.180 
Say it with me.

15
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.290 
Pretty good, once again.

16
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.730 
Do you work in finances?

17
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.680 
Pretty good, nice, nice.

18
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.420 
And an answer can be, I work with the government.

19
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.320 
I work with the government.

20
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.540 
Esa puede ser una respuesta.

21
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.400 
I work with the government.

22
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.980 
You?

23
00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.210 
Pretty good, nice.

24
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.310 
Once again, I work with the government.

25
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.980 
Pretty good, nice, nice.

26
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.740 
So, another thing you can say is, I work
closely with the sales team.

27
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.920 
I work closely with the sales team.

28
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.560 
Trabajo muy de cerca o en estrecha

29
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.540 
colaboración con el equipo de ventas.

30
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.940 
I work closely with the sales team.

31
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.420 
So, closely means that you're familiar
with what you're talking about.

32
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
So, closely significa que estás cercano y
estás familiarizado con lo que estás hablando.

33
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.960 
Por ejemplo, si estás hablando, I work
closely with my sales team or with the

34
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.640 
sales teams.

35
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.760 
Quiere decir que estás muy familiarizado

36
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.000 
y que trabajas muy de cerca con el team
de ventas.

37

So, I work closely with the sales team.

38
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.080 
Excellent, pretty nice.

Once again, I work closely with the sales team.

41
00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.920

Does he work in finances?

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.820 
Does he work in finances?

45
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.700

Nice.

57
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.200 
Nice.

58
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.480
