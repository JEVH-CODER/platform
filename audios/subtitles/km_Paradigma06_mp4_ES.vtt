00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.140 
A group of people was huddled up in a
dark room.

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.980 
The atmosphere was thick with tension,
like they were hiding out.

3
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.040 
At the same time, there was so much
commotion that many feared getting caught

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.540 
with their hands in the cookie jar
.

5
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.860 
Things were rough back home, so they had
a major fork in the road.

6
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.120 
Stick around and keep grinding for a
better life or pack up and roll

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.420 
the dice elsewhere, hoping for a better shot.

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.140 
Everyone was on board with the idea of

9
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.000 
leaving, even though it was a real tough call.

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.680 
The next snag was picking which country

11
00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.180 
to head to.

12
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.140 
Some were itching to hit up Italy because

13
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.120 
they figured Italian would be a breeze to
pick up.

14
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.640 
Others had their eyes on Australia,
thinking they could lay low in the

15
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.520 
jungles without anyone catching on.

16
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.440 
And a few were gunning for the United

17
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.100 
States, since it's the so -called world's
leading power and land of the free.

18
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.460 
This crew of about 400 people huddled up
to hash things out.

19
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.040 
Australia got the boot first because it
was on the far side of the planet, and

20
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.240 
they'd have to sail forever.

21
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.000 
That left only two choices, Italy and the

22
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
United States.

23
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.160 
They took a vote, and the result was a landslide.

24
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
We're going to be very good.

25
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.640 
In fact, And we're going to a little bit
