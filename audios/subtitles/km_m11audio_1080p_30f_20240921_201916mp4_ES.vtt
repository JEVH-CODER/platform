Chapter 3, The Successful Politician.

7
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.820 
Early Beginnings.

8
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.900 
In 2015, Dr. Ben Carson, celebrated for

9
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.200 
his groundbreaking work as a
neurosurgeon, ventured into the political

10
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.820 
arena with the aim of securing the
Republican nomination for President of

11
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.600 
the United States.

12
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.860 
He smelled the opportunity in the air, nevertheless.

13
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.620 
Not once did he underestimate the
challenges he would face in this highly

14
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.360 
competitive race.

15
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.260 
One could feel it was going to be

16
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.640 
extremely tough, because he would have to
compete against candidates such as Donald

17
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.680 
Trump, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz.

18
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.960 
Controversial Issues.

19
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.740 
Dr. Carson had strong and clear opinions
on controversial issues.

20
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.020 
On abortion, he was firmly pro -life,
advocating for the protection of unborn children.

21
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.820 
He believed that life begins at
conception and opposed abortion, except

22
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.640 
in cases where the mother's life was at risk.

23
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.060 
On drug policy, Carson supported a tough

24
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.480 
stance on illegal drugs, but also
emphasized the importance of addressing

25
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.400 
addiction through rehabilitation, rather
than solely through punitive measures.

26
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.460 
Campaign Events.

27
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.800 
As the campaign progressed, Dr. Carson

28
00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.660 
was often seen at various events,
delivering speeches and participating in debates.

29
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.220 
He used to emphasize his outsider
perspective and medical expertise, hoping

30
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to appeal to voters who valued these traits.

31
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.120 
Dr. Carson would often reflect on his

32
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.460 
experiences as a neurosurgeon during his campaign.

33
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.020 
He saw that the competition was fierce,

34
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.400 
setbacks and withdrawal.

35
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.460 
In March 2016, following a disappointing

36
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.940 
Super Tuesday performance, Carson decided
to suspend his campaign.

37
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.400 
His decision was influenced by the
realization that he was unlikely to

38
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.780 
secure the nomination, due to his
inability to compete effectively against

39
00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.260 
his better funded and more politically
connected rivals.

40
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.720 
After all, he had been a neurosurgeon all
his life and not a politician like the others.

41
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.900 
Never had he faced such a challenging
political environment.

42
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.280 
And so he tasted the bitterness of defeat
early in the race.

43
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.

44
00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.060 
In 2017, Dr. Carson got appointed as the

45
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.340 
Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development HUD by President Donald Trump.

46
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.460 
There were speculations about how Carson
might get another chance to run for

47
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.780 
office again in the future, whether as a
senator or in another significant role.

48
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.820 
His political career, characterized by
how he got to transition from a renowned

49
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.680 
neurosurgeon to a public servant
, showcased how he got used to his new

50
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.580 
role and the challenges it brought
.

51
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.580 
This transition showed how Dr. Carson got
to adapt and thrive in a completely

52
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.900 
different field, demonstrating his
versatility and commitment to public service.
