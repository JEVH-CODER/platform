00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.380 
Marta and Alberto have a 35 -year -old
daughter named Sandra.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.800 
She's killing it in her career and has a
job to die for.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.460 
She's respectful and super responsible,
everything any parent could dream of.

4
00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.120 
But they're tearing their hair out
because she's not married and doesn't

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.440 
even seem to give a hoot about it.

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.520 
So they cooked up a plan.

7
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560 
Hire someone to nudge her while she's
chilling at her favorite coffee shop.

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.820 
Let's check out this scene at the cafe
. Hey, what's up?

9
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.200 
Not much, you.

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.660 
All good.

11
00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.540 
I see you're a coffee fan, huh?

12
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.220 
Yeah, I'm obsessed.

13
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.040 
And you've been here before?

14
00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.760 
Like this cafe's your jam?

15
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.900 
Yep, I grab a coffee here every morning.

16
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.040 
Cool.

17
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.840 
I'd love to get the lowdown on you.

18
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.340 
Uh, okay, that's kind of random, but shoot?

19
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.780 
So are you hitched?

20
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.220 
Nah, not yet.

21
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.960 
Then you've got a boyfriend, right?

22
00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.800 
Nah, not yet.

23
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.460 
I'm flying solo right now.

24
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.520 
But, you've been married before, right?

25
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.520 
Like, divorced or something?

26
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.000 
Nope.

27
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.800 
Always been single.

28
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.640 
Oh my gosh, how old are you?

29
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.120 
I'm 35.

30
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.380 
You're totally missing the boat, girl.

31
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.140 
Don't you ever feel lonely?

32
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.220 
Nah, I've got a pet, so...

33
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.900 
But do you really think a pet can take
the place of a lifetime partner and

34
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.640 
replace a human being?

35
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.760 
I'll be happy to meet you in the upcoming

36
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.940 
audience right now
.

37
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.120 
But to my...

38
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.120 
I think, if you don't know, make up long

39
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
term for some COVID demos, I'll be happy
to keep one of this.

40
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.640 
Gracias.
