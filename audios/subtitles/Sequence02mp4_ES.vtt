00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.480 
Once upon a time, on a boat gently moving
under the sun, lived a man named Ben, his

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.300 
wife Sarah, and their daughter Lily.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.100 
They had made this boat their home, but

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.760 
it was more than just a place to live.

5
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.480 
It was their jam, inside, behind worn

6
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.200 
wooden walls.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.440 
They had a small clothes factory.

8
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.440 
Ben had always wanted to work for
himself, and, well, the boat idea just clicked.

9
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.020 
It was a risky move, but they took the
chance, and now they were producing the

10
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.960 
most unique, handcrafted clothes
.

11
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.720 
This is where their story begins, where
work, family, and secrets weave together

12
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.620 
like threads in a fabric.

13
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.520 
Every day, they moved the boat near small

14
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.360 
coastal towns, offering their clothes to
curious visitors.

15
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.680 
Who knew you could make a whole factory
fit on a boat?

16
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.800 
People would often say, staring in
disbelief, Ben always smiled and replied,

17
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.560 
Well, when pigs fly, you'll see a factory
that works harder than this one.

18
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.360 
Lily, now 17 years old, had lived on the
boat her whole life.

19
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.000 
She knew its creaks, its sounds, and the
salty air that filled every corner.

20
00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.900 
She loved to play on the deck, sometimes
imagining they were on an adventure in

21
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.360 
far -off lands.

22
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.640 
One day, as they finished their last

23
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.580 
piece of clothing for the week, Sarah
called Lily inside.

24
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.040 
Come help me fold these shirts.

25
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.520 
We've got a big order tomorrow.

26
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.280 
How big?

27
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.240 
Lily asked, curious.

28
00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.720 
About 500 shirts.

29
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.460 
Her mother replied, her hands moving swiftly.

30
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.440 
I hope we get it done in time.

31
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.320 
Ben, listening from behind them, sighed,

32
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.560 
If we keep cutting corners, we're going
to have to go back to square one.

33
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.480 
We've already burned the midnight oil
three times this week.

34
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.860 
Sarah stopped folding and looked at him.

35
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.100 
Don't worry.

36
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.600 
We'll make it work.

37
00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.100 
We always do.

38
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.000 
The nights on the boat were quiet, with
the occasional sound of the waves beneath them.

39
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.820 
But one night, something changed.

40
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.860 
It was a calm evening.

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.360 
Lily had just turned off the lights and
was about to fall asleep when she heard it.

42
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.680 
A soft bump against the side of the boat.

43
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.620 
She sat up, her heart racing.

44
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.780 
Dad?

45
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
She called out softly.

46
00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.500 
No answer.

47
00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.320 
Cautiously, she tiptoed outside.

48
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:32.460 
There, near the back of the boat, she saw
something or someone moving in the shadows.

49
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.360 
Ben exclaimed the next morning, as Lily
told her parents what she saw.

50
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.320 
I swear, there was someone there.

51
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.420 
I couldn't see them clearly, but I'm not

52
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.100 
making this up.

53
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.400 
Lily said.

54
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.340 
Her voice high -key shook.

55
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.400 
Ben and Sarah exchanged worried glances.

56
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.800 
Okay.

57
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.500 
Sarah said calmly.

58
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.280 
Maybe it's nothing.

59
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.680 
But we'll keep an eye out.

60
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.100 
Let's not get salty over it
.

61
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.020 
Over the next few days, strange things
started to happen.

62
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.820 
A batch of shirts, which had been neatly
folded, appeared out of place.

63
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.720 
Once, they even found a shirt completely
soaked, despite having left it dry under

64
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.700 
the roof.

65
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.860 
Lily would wake up in the middle of the

66
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.620 
night, hearing footsteps outside her room.

67
00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.260 
This is getting sus.

68
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.740 
She whispered one morning to her dad.

69
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.800 
What do you mean?

70
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.600 
Ben asked, glancing over at Sarah.

71
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.220 
How could there be anyone on board

72
00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.080 
without us noticing?

73
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.840 
I don't know, but it's vibing way off.

74
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.700 
That afternoon, they decided to search
every inch of the boat.

75
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.200 
They looked under every shelf, behind
every curtain, but found nothing, until

76
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.740 
Ben opened the storage room door.

77
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.260 
There, inside, hidden behind the boxes of

78
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.520 
fabric, they found an old man.

79
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.340 
His clothes were ragged, his face worn by

80
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.160 
the sea, and his eyes wide with fear.

81
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.720 
Ben muttered, backing up.

82
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.420 
Sarah gasped, and Lily stood frozen.

83
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.860 
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.280 
The old man said, holding up his hands.

85
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.260 
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

86
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.580 
I've just been hiding here for a few days.

87
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.780 
Please, don't kick me out.

88
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.460 
Who are you?

89
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.100 
And what are you doing here?

90
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.940 
Sarah asked her voice firm.

91
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.120 
My name is Tom.

92
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.720 
I used to live in these waters, but I
lost everything.

93
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.680 
I saw your boat, and I thought I could,
you know, hide.

94
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.320 
I didn't want to bother you, I swear.

95
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.520 
Ben was speechless, but Lily felt a

96
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.320 
strange sympathy for the man.

97
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.160 
Dad.

98
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.420 
She whispered, Maybe we could help him.

99
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
No way.

100
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.280 
Ben replied, shaking his head.

101
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.840 
We're not running a charity here.

102
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.680 
But Sarah thought for a moment.

103
00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.240 
Why don't you work with us for a while?

104
00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.980 
You can help with the clothes, and once
you've earned enough, we'll let you go.

105
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.300 
Tom's eyes lit up.

106
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.880 
I'd be so grateful.

107
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.260 
He said, his voice low -key desperate.

108
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.480 
Weeks passed, and Tom became part of

109
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.580 
their routine.

110
00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.580 
He worked hard, sewing and cutting,

111
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.960 
making the most out of what Louie had.

112
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.800 
Lily would ask him questions all the time.

113
00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
How old are you?

114
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.580 
She asked once.

115
00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.360 
Sixty -two.

116
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.740 
He replied, I've been on these waters for

117
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.100 
as long as I can remember.

118
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.060 
But as time went on, more secrets began

119
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.560 
to spill.

120
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.740 
Lily overheard Tom talking to someone on

121
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.200 
the radio late one night.

122
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.740 
Could you say that again?

123
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.640 
He whispered from the shadows.

124
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.080 
He repeated something about a shipment,

125
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.220 
about someone coming to take the boat.

126
00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.340 
Lily felt her heart skip a beat.

127
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.520 
She went straight to her parents.

128
00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.240 
Tom isn't who he says he is.

129
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.240 
He's planning something, something big.

130
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.240 
I heard him say they're coming for the boat.

131
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.560 
Ben, now suspicious, decided to confront Tom.

132
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.100 
Tom, what's really going on here?

133
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.700 
He demanded the next morning.

134
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.420 
Tom, caught off guard, stuttered.

135
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.860 
I didn't want to involve you.

136
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.960 
I owe a lot of people a lot of money.

137
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.280 
They've been chasing me, and I thought,
maybe this boat could save me.

138
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.000 
And now they're coming for us?

139
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.160 
Sarah asked, her voice sharp.

140
00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.940 
Tom hung his head.

141
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.940 
Yes, I'm sorry.

142
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.900 
I didn't mean for this to happen.

143
00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.980 
The family had no choice.

144
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.580 
They packed up their things and moved the
boat further out to sea, hoping to avoid

145
00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.380 
the danger coming their way.

146
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.160 
But deep down, they knew they were on

147
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.120 
thin ice.

148
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.300 
Tom had brought trouble into their lives,

149
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.460 
and the question now was, how long could
they escape it?
