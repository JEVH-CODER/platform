00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.300 
Okay, these questions are going to be
really interesting.

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.720 
So put your answers in the comments below.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:07.640 
Be honest.

4
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.180 
Number one, Alex, for instance, back in
the early 20s, some governments used to

5
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.120 
restrict internet access during times of
political unrest.

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.640 
So what did governments do during times
of political unrest in the early 20s?

7
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.160 
Next, Jamie, the prohibition of social
media would likely lead to unintended consequences.

8
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.300 
For example, when governments prohibited
social media in the past, the results

9
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.160 
were often counterproductive.

10
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.400 
Okay, so the question is, what was the

11
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.120 
common outcome when governments banned
social media in the past, according to Jamie?

12
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.400 
Next, number three.

13
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
Jamie, the future of social media and its

14
00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.740 
role in society should be managed with
careful thought rather than sweeping bans.

15
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.320 
So, what does Jamie suggest that should
be done with social media instead of

16
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.320 
banning it?

17
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.580 
What does Jamie suggest that should be

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.700 
done instead of banning social media?

19
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.420 
Alright, quiero ver tus preguntas.

20
00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.540 
I want to see your questions.

21
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.800 
Put them down in questions in the

22
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.680 
comments section.
