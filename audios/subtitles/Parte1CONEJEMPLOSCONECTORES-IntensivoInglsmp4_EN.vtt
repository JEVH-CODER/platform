00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.120 
However, I wanted to join the meeting,
however, I was caught in traffic.

2
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.080 
On the other hand, he likes working
alone, on the other hand, teamwork is

3
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.640 
often required in this role.

4
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.380 
Nonetheless, she was exhausted,

5
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.900 
nonetheless, she continued working.

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.720 
Nevertheless, it was raining heavily,

7
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.120 
nevertheless, they went for a walk.

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.560 
Despite this, he had little experience.

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.860 
Despite this, he was given the project.

10
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.360 
In contrast, the city is always bustling,

11
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.280 
in contrast to the quiet countryside.

12
00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.400 
Even so, it was a long day, even so, he

13
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.720 
went out to dinner with friends.

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.940 
Alternatively, you can go by train,

15
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.340 
alternatively, there is a bus service.

16
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.220 
While, she enjoys reading while he

17
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.520 
prefers watching movies.

18
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.800 
Whereas, some prefer a steady routine,

19
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.740 
whereas others thrive on change.

20
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.840 
Yet, it's a simple idea, yet it's hard to execute.

21
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
Conversely, the South experiences a wet
season, conversely, the North is usually dry.

22
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.580 
Although, although he was tired, he
decided to finish the report.

23
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.280 
Even though, even though she knew the
answer, she hesitated to respond.

24
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.660 
Be that as it may, be that as it may, we
still need a solution.

25
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.180 
At the same time, I was thrilled to get
the job, at the same time, I felt nervous

26
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.100 
about the new role.

27
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.860 
On the contrary, I thought it would be

28
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.580 
difficult, on the contrary, it was quite simple.

29
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.620 
In spite of, in spite of the challenges,

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.940 
she excelled in her role, rather than, he
chose to relax rather than work on his project.

31
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.560 
Nonetheless, the project faced many
challenges, nonetheless, it was completed

32
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.260 
on time.

33
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.520 
Regardless, she decided to continue with

34
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.700 
her plan, regardless of the difficulties.

35
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.680 
In any case, we might be late, but in any

36
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.160 
case, we'll try to get there as soon as possible.

37
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.440 
Albeit, the company reported a profit,

38
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.760 
albeit a small one.

39
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.720 
Though, he worked hard, though he was not

40
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.460 
feeling well.

41
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.480 
While this may be true, there are other

42
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:35.620 
factors to consider.

43
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.040 
Contrary to, contrary to popular belief,

44
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.860 
not all cats dislike water.

45
00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.280 
Whereas, John loves hiking, whereas his

46
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.480 
brother prefers cycling.

47
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.340 
In comparison,

48
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.420 
In comparison to last year, this year's
sales have increased significantly.

49
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.380 
Despite, she achieved great results
despite facing many obstacles.

50
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.040 
Therefore, the weather forecast predicts
rain, therefore, the event has been postponed.

51
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.020 
As a result, she studied hard for weeks,
as a result, she passed the exam.

52
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.280 
Consequently, the team failed to meet the
deadline and, consequently, lost the contract.

53
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.080 
Hence, he forgot his keys at home, hence,
he was locked out.

54
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.700 
Thus, they didn't prepare for the
meeting, thus, it was less productive.

55
00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.500 
Due to, the flight was delayed due to bad weather.

56
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.700 
For this reason, she was unable to attend

57
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.040 
the meeting and for this reason, she sent
an email update.

58
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.880 
So that, he studied extra hours so that
he could pass the exam.

59
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.080 
Owing to, owing to the high demand, the
product sold out quickly.

60
00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.340 
In order to, she saved money in order to
buy a new car.

61
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
Accordingly, the market shifted and
accordingly, they adjusted their strategy.

62
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.020 
That's why, she missed her bus, that's
why she was late.

63
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.020 
On account of, they stayed indoors on
account of the storm.

64
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.020 
With this in mind, the team prioritized
efficiency, with this in mind when

65
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.140 
designing the project.

66
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.180 
For this purpose, they hired a specialist

67
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.060 
for this purpose.

68
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.480 
To this end, to this end, they allocated

69
00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.220 
more resources to research.

70
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.380 
In consequence, in consequence of his

71
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:46.540 
actions, he was promoted, resulting in,
the heavy rains flooded the area,

72
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.140 
resulting in road closures.

73
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.100 
Because of, they canceled the picnic

74
00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.340 
because of the rain.

75
00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.060 
In light of this, in light of this

76
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.660 
information, we should reconsider our approach.

77
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
For instance, some animals are quite

78
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.500 
intelligent, for instance, dolphins can
learn complex tasks.

79
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.680 
For example, there are many ways to
improve your health, for example, regular

80
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.580 
exercise and a balanced diet.

81
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.860 
To illustrate, to illustrate this point,

82
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.800 
consider the following scenario, such as,
she enjoys outdoor activities such as

83
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.620 
hiking and biking.

84
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
As an illustration, as an illustration,

85
00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.060 
think of a tree growing towards the light.

86
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.600 
In particular, he enjoys classical music,

87
00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.800 
in particular, the works of Mozart.

88
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.820 
Including, the trip includes activities

89
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.580 
such as kayaking, hiking and birdwatching.

90
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.740 
Namely, three cities were chosen, mainly

91
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.720 
New York, London and Tokyo.

92
00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.640 
Specifically, she was looking for

93
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.540 
specifically designed shoes for running.

94
00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.080 
In the case of, in the case of an

95
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.860 
emergency, please follow the evacuation plan.

96
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.580 
Consider the following, consider the

97
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.280 
following example to better understand
the concept.

98
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.400 
Take, for example, take, for example, the
way technology has changed communication.

99
00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.820 
A prime example is, a prime example is
the rapid rise of smartphone usage.

100
00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.000 
As seen in, the effectiveness of this
strategy is evident, as seen in last

101
00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.040 
quarter's results.

102
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:37.100 
This can be seen in, this can be seen in

103
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.720 
the way they approach their projects.

104
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.680 
By way of illustration, by way of

105
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.880 
illustration, let's look at a recent
study on climate change.

106
00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:51.540 
This is illustrated by, this is
illustrated by the number of successful

107
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.260 
projects completed last year.

108
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.280 
To give an example, to give an example,

109
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.640 
she cited several successful companies.

110
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.300 
One example is, one example is the impact

111
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.120 
of education on community health.

112
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.240 
In this case, in this case, we should

113
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.300 
proceed with caution.

114
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.100 
Moreover, the program is affordable,

Likewise, the new policy affects
students, likewise, it impacts teachers.

Similarly, similarly, both species share
common features.

In summary, in summary, the benefits far
outweigh the costs.

139

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:29.260 
Thus, thus, we should proceed with the plan.

152
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:33.520 
As a final point, as a final point,

in the effort.

200
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.880

others don't.

208
00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.420

experience, he should lead the project.

214
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:48.220 
In case, take an umbrella in case it rains.

Supposing, supposing you win the lottery,
what would you do with the money?

Should.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.080 
In such a case, in such a case, we will
need to adjust our plans.

221
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:22.220 
If not, we can go to the park, if not, we
can stay home and watch a movie.

222
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.000 
On condition.

227
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.040 
If so, let me know if you're interested,

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.360 
if so, I can give you more details.

229
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.880 
In any circumstance, in any circumstance,

230
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:46.680 
safety is our top priority.

231
00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.600 
I believe, I believe that everyone

232
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.020 
deserves a second chance.

233
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.460 
In my opinion, in my opinion, teamwork is

234
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.760 
essential for success.

235
00:14:58.770 --> 00:15:02.200 
Personally, personally, I prefer to work

236
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.480 
in a quiet environment.

237
00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:07.900 
To my mind, to my mind, the decision was

238
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:08.520 
a mistake.

239
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.500 
From my perspective, from my perspective,

240
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:14.600 
we need to reconsider our approach.

241
00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.000 
I feel that, I feel that communication is

242
00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:20.580 
key to a healthy relationship.

243
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.760 
As far as I'm concerned, as far as I'm

244
00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.100 
concerned, this issue needs immediate attention.

245
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:31.160 
I would argue that, I would argue that

246
00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.400 
education is the foundation of society.

247
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:37.460 
It seems to me, it seems to me that we

248
00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:38.440 
are making progress.

249
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:42.660 
I am convinced that, I am convinced that

250
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.180 
hard work leads to success.

251
00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.900 
I think, I think we should try a

252
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:48.760 
different strategy.

253
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:52.640 
To the best of my knowledge, to the best

254
00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.920 
of my knowledge, the project is on schedule.

255
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.340 
In my view, in my view, everyone should

256
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.980 
have access to quality healthcare.

257
00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:05.180 
My impression is that, my impression is

258
00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:06.880 
that the team is feeling more confident.

259
00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.840 
I hold the view that, I hold the view

260
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:12.800 
that technology can enhance education.

261
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.140 
I strongly believe, I strongly believe in

262
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:19.000 
the importance of mental health awareness.

263
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:35.660 
I am of the opinion that, I am of the

264
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.160 
opinion that collaboration fosters innovation.

265
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:42.340 
It is my firm belief, it is my firm

266
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:44.300 
belief that kindness goes a long way.

267
00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.120 
Others claim that, others claim that

268
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:50.760 
social media can be detrimental to mental health.

269
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.800 
Some argue that, some argue that the

270
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:57.100 
benefits of technology outweigh the risks.

271
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:00.860 
There is a school of thought that, there

272
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.540 
is a school of thought that emphasizes
the role of nature in education.

273
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:10.760 
Critics argue that, critics argue that
the new policy could harm the environment.

274
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:17.240 
On the flip side, on the flip side,
increased automation could lead to job losses.

275
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:24.120 
Opponents believe, opponents believe that
the changes will negatively impact small businesses.
