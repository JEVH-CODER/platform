So, I'm sure that you're going to learn
something very interesting today.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.200 
And the first phrase is, is that your dad?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.100 
Is that your dad?

8
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.400 
So, when you want to ask somebody, like,
is that your mom? Is that your dad?

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.180 
You can say, is that your...

10
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.760

11
00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:27.400

12
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.900 
Okay, cuando le quieres preguntar a

13
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.160 
alguien si ese es su papá o su mamá o
algo así, simplemente utilizas, is that

14
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.660

16
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.700

17
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.680 
En este caso, is that your dad?

18
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.520 
¿Es ese tu papá?

19
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.800 
And you can say, no, that's my ankle.
