You gotta be kidding me.

2
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.320 
Um, we've all been focused on giving God

3
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.800 
the glory and, and I'm so grateful for them.

4
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.920 
I'm grateful to my incredible husband of

5
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.780 
40 years.

6
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.880 
Even though I'm, I'm stuck with the name

7
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.360 
Winans, my last name
has been love for over 40 years

8
00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.560 
.

9
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.500 
And he has lived up to his name.

10
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.260 
Thank you so much, Bae.

11
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.700 
To my wonderful children, to my

12
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.960 
grandchildren, I have three with another
one on the way.

13
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
Amazing.

14
00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.380 
Um, to all of you who have played my

15
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.120 
songs and have come to our concerts, um,
to my family, the Winans, all of my

16
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.800 
brothers and sisters, my mom and dad,
where it all started

17
00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.880 
.

18
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.200 
Um, you know, I, I was speaking the other

19
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.860 
day and it came to me that all of us, you
know, I was thinking of myself at the

20
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.360 
time that I'm known for my music all of
the world, all over the world, people

21
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.900 
know me for my music, right?

22
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.180 
But, but God only knows me for my

23
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.760 
relationship with him.

24
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.680 
He only knows us according to the way we

25
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.080 
know him.

26
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.980 
Um, and so all of us here tonight as all

27
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
of the artists, the artists that I was in
the categories with, I mean, I just came

28
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.100 
to cheer them on tonight.

29
00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
I didn't think this was going to happen, um,

30
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.620 
but, but God is faithful all my life.

31
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.400 
He's been faithful all my life

32
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.260 
. He's been good with every breath that
I'm able.

33
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.820 
I will sing of the goodness of God.

34
00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.740 
Thank you so much.

35
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.240 
I love you.
