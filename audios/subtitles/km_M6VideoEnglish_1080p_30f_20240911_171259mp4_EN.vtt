Esto es una producción de Choco Inglés.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Escucha esta producción varias veces hasta que le entiendas bien.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Recuerda que la meta es que puedas comprender la historia sin ver la lectura.

4
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Valeria arrived at the police station with a heavy heart.

5
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.990
She’s got to find her brother soon.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
She approached the front desk and said,

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
«Hello, how was your day?»

8
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
«I’m here because I was called to check several bodies to see if any belong to my missing brother, David».

9
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The officer at the desk nodded and leads her to the room with the bodies that arrived today.

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Valeria searches for David's body, trying to find any resemblance to David.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
She had examined several bodies when the officer directed her to another room where the bodies that arrived some time ago were kept.

12
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"Come with me, the bodies are kept in another room."

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.990
He said.

14
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
As they walked towards that room, Valeria unexpectedly ran into Daniel,

15
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
an old schoolmate who was now a dean.

16
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
«Hi there! What's up?»

17
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
She asked, surprised to see him there.

18
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Daniel, clearly caught off guard, responded evasively.

19
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.990
«Oh, um.

20
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I'm here for some, um.

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Some administrative tasks».

22
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
He said quickly.

23
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
«What do you do now?

24
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Are you still a high school teacher?»

25
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
He added, trying to change the subject.

26
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Valeria looked at him with curiosity.

27
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
«Yes, but I need your help.

28
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm here because my brother is missing.

29
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Do you know something?»

30
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
She asked.

31
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Daniel hesitated before saying,

32
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
«Um, of course I don't know.

33
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Are you still single?»

34
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
«Yes, but the word still sounds rude».

35
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Said Valeria.

36
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
«Oh, sorry.

37
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
What time is it?

38
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Daniel asked.

39
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
«12 o'clock, why?»

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
«I think I'll go now».

41
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Said Daniel, and without waiting for more questions, he left the room.

42
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Valeria entered the second room and continued her search.

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The bodies were examined by Valeria, but unfortunately, she did not find David's body.

44
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Disheartened, she exited the morgue and saw Daniel standing outside, waiting for her.

45
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
«I've been waiting for you».

46
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Daniel said.

47
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
«I'd like to invite you out for a coffee or something».

48
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Valeria gave Daniel a puzzled look and replied.

49
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
«You're strange».

50
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
As Valeria left the morgue, she noticed that there were several people standing in front

51
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of the building, waiting for news.

52
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
«There are a lot of people here».

53
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
She thought.

54
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
She realized that most of them were also waiting for information about their loved ones.

55
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Valeria decided not to hang out with Daniel later.

56
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In the meantime, she needed to make sure she got some rest.

57
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:30.360
She hoped that tomorrow would be a lucky day.
