1
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:05.760 
Harm.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.720 
Causing harm will never solve a problem.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.440 
The cost and harm caused by pollution is
affecting the environment in ways we

4
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.600 
cannot even imagine.

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
Create for me.

6
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.400 
Could you create something truly unique?

7
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.360 
If you could create a world where

8
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.240 
everyone had equal opportunities, what
would it look like?

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.380 
So when?

10
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.180 
So when will you finally tell me the truth?

11
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.420 
So when you finally decide to take a leap
of faith and start your own business,

12
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.600 
make sure you're prepared for all the
challenges ahead.

13
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.260 
Drones.

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.100 
The busting of drones kept me awake all night.

15
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.560 
Drones are being increasingly used for
surveillance, which raises questions

16
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.180 
about privacy and safety.

17
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.420 
Mushrooms.

18
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.640 
Mushrooms grow quickly after heavy rain.

19
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.720 
After the storm, the mushrooms in the

20
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.900 
forest grew so quickly that we couldn't
believe our eyes.

21
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.400 
Scholars.

22
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.700 
Scholars debated for hours about the discovery.

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.660 
The scholars at the conference presented
groundbreaking research on how climate

24
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.160 
change is affecting global ecosystems.

25
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.060 
Germans.

26
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.700 
The Germans are known for their precision
and efficiency.

27
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.140 
Many of the Germans in the study were
shocked by the environmental changes they

28
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.000 
witnessed during their travels abroad.

29
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.940 
Some.

30
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.840 
Some.

31
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.580 
Some people prefer working late at night.

32
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.300 
Some argue that the technology is helping
us while others believe it is slowly

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.800 
making us lose touch with the real world.

34
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.100 
Joking.

35
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.560 
He was just joking.

36
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.660 
Don't take it seriously.

37
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.180 
After hours of joking each other, they
finally stopped and realized how much

38
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.020 
they had missed their old friendship.

39
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.920 
Pranking.

40
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.820 
Stop pranking your sister.

41
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.180 
She's getting upset.

42
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.900 
Pranking.

43
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.680 
He spent the whole afternoon pranking his

44
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.920 
friends, and by the time they realized
that, everyone was laughing uncontrollably.

45
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.160 
Teasing.

46
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.260 
She was teasing him about his new haircut.

47
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.560 
The class was full of students who were
teasing each other about their homework,

48
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.160 
but everyone still managed to finish on time.

49
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.260 
Spy.

50
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.140 
The spy had access to secret information.

51
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.260 
The spy was so skilled at remaining

52
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.560 
undetected that no one knew he was
gathering information on the enemy's plans.

53
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.720 
Laptop.

54
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.600 
I forgot my laptop at home.

55
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.640 
I took my laptop to the cafe to finish my
work, but ended up spending hours

56
00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.380 
chatting with friends instead.

57
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.820 
Insane.

58
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.320 
That was an insane idea, but it worked.

59
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.320 
It may seem insane to try and change the

60
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.460 
world on your own, but sometimes a single
person's efforts can make a huge difference.

61
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.640 
Night owl.

62
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.100 
I'm a night owl.

63
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.740 
I'm most active at night.

64
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.540 
Being a night owl, she enjoys working on

65
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.420 
creative projects during the quiet hours
of the night when everyone else is asleep.

66
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
Early bird.

67
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.360 
I'm an early bird.

68
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.880 
I wake up at 5 a .m.

69
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.340 
As an early bird, I find that I'm most

70
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.780 
productive in the few hours after I wake
up, when the world's still calm.

71
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.920 
Tech savvy.

72
00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.580 
He's very tech savvy and loves learning

73
00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.220 
new things.

74
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.160 
The younger generation is incredibly tech

75
00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.840 
savvy, effortlessly adapting to new
technologies and innovations.

76
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.700 
Brown.

77
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.040 
She's prone to getting sick in the winter.

78
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.720 
He's prone to making impulsive decisions,
which sometimes lead to unexpected consequences.

79
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:40.460 
Peanut butter.

80
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.980 
I spray peanut butter on my toast every morning.

81
00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.700 
I always spray peanut butter on my toast
in the morning because it gives me the

82
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.860 
energy I need for all the day ahead.

83
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.540 
Spill.

84
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.700 
Be careful not to spill your drink.

85
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.980 
Be careful when you carry that glass.

86
00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.920 
Don't spill it on your clothes or the carpet.

87
00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.880 
Loudest.

88
00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.140 
She's the loudest person in the room.

89
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.380 
She was the loudest at the party, but her

90
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.980 
energy made everyone feel welcome and alive.

91
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.900 
Calm down.

92
00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.300 
Calm down and take a deep breath.

93
00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.120 
I told him to calm down, but his

94
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.960 
frustration only grew as the situation
became more intense.

95
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:19.480 
Surpass.

96
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.680 
You will surpass all expectations.

97
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.480 
If you keep practicing, you'll eventually
surpass all your goals and achieve even

98
00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.100 
more than you expected.

99
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.020 
Outshine.

100
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.180 
Your performance today really outshines
the rest.

101
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.520 
Her talent and determination continue to
outshine everyone else in the competition.

102
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.800 
Outdo.

103
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.920 
She will outdo herself every year.

104
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.460 
You can outdo yourself every time, but
only if you push beyond your limits and

105
00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.080 
challenge yourself constantly.

106
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.080 
It doesn't have to be easy.

107
00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.600 
It doesn't have to be easy, but it should
be worth it.

108
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.900 
It doesn't have to be easy, but you must
be willing to work hard and persevere to

109
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.560 
see results.

110
00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.060 
It has to be easy.

111
00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.700 
It has to be easy for everybody to understand.

112
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.360 
It has to be easy for everyone to follow,

113
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.240 
or the message won't reach as many people
as it should.

114
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.320 
Word, yeah.

115
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.640 
Outdo word of the attackers.

116
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
The gate was locked, but I managed to
word of the security guard and get inside.

117
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.390 
On that day.

118
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.550 
On that day, we made history.

119
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.970 
On that day, everything changed, and we
realized that our lives would never be

120
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.670 
the same again.

121
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.910 
Logs.

122
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.370 
The forest was filled with fallen logs.

123
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:39.950 
The workers cut down several logs to

124
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.550 
build a house, but they had to be careful
not to damage the surrounding trees.

125
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.490 
Should I go?

126
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.310 
Should I go to the party tonight?

127
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.070 
Should I go to the new restaurant
tonight, or would it be better to wait

128
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.010 
until next week?

129
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.130 
It's going to be.

130
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:56.570 
The meeting is going to be long.

131
00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.370 
The event is going to be a great success,

132
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.650 
considering all the preparation and
effort that went into it.

133
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.510 
What?

134
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.430 
What is the meaning of life?

135
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.250 
What do you think about the new proposal
for the project?

136
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.610 
What you were telling me.

137
00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.310 
What you were telling me was really interesting.

138
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.450 
What you were telling me about the
situation made me reconsider my decision.

139
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.430 
Game changer.

140
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.050 
That idea was a real game changer for our company.

141
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.590 
The new policy was a game changer for the
company's future.

142
00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.870 
What they want to say.

143
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.030 
I don't care what they want to say about me.

144
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.130 
What they want to say is important, but
they haven't found the right words yet.

145
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.030 
Intentionally.

146
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.330 
She said it intentionally to make him

147
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.890 
feel bad.

148
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.230 
He spoke intentionally, making sure every

149
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.330 
word had purpose.

150
00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.370 
The only thing you need to do is try your best.

151
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.390 
The only thing you need to do is stay
focused and keep moving forward.

152
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.430 
The faster, the better.

153
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.550 
The faster, the better when it comes to

154
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.070 
this project.

155
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.870 
The faster, the better, especially when

156
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.990 
it comes to meeting deadlines.

157
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.970 
The more she spoke, the more she cried.

158
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.730 
The more she spoke, the more she cried.

159
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.570 
The more she spoke, the more she cried,

160
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.570 
revealing the depth of her emotions.

161
00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.770 
I could feel they were proud of us.

162
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.430 
I could feel they were proud of us after representation.

163
00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.910 
I could feel they were proud of us when

164
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.810 
they gave us that standing ovation.

165
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.130 
Canvassing.

166
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.910 
The politicians spent the day canvassing
for votes.

167
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:44.450 
During the election season, many
volunteers were involved in canvassing to

168
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.130 
gather votes.

169
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.990 
Spill the tea.

170
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.330 
Scoop it and spill the tea about your life.

171
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.350 
Spill the tea.

172
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.070 
We all want to know what happened at the
party last night.

173
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.470 
It's got to be easy.

174
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.090 
It's got to be easy or no one will do it.

175
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.240 
If it's too difficult, we should simplify
it because it's got to be easy for

176
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.660 
everyone to understand.

177
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.060 
It's not rocket science.

178
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:10.560 
Hey, it's not rocket science.

179
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.600 
Anyone can do it.

180
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.120 
It's not rocket science.

181
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.880 
Just follow the instructions and you'll

182
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:15.380 
be fine.

183
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.520 
Have I ever told you I like your food?

184
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.740 
Have I ever told you I like your food?

185
00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:23.540 
Have I ever told you I like your food?

186
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.060 
It's always so delicious.

187
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.560 
In what way did Pilate attempt to

188
00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:30.720 
persuade the crowd to seek Jesus' release?

189
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.660 
In what way did Pilate attempt to

190
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:34.860 
persuade the crowd to seek Jesus' release?

191
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:37.980 
In what way did Pilate attempt to

192
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.980 
persuade the crowd to seek Jesus' release?

193
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.300 
How did Pilate try to persuade the people

194
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:45.800 
to ask for Jesus' release?

195
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:47.920 
How did Pilate try to persuade the people

196
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.080 
to ask for Jesus' release?

197
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:51.640 
How did Pilate try to persuade the people

198
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:52.820 
to ask for Jesus' release?

199
00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:55.400 
Brigand.

200
00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.860 
The brigand was notorious for robbing
travelers on the lonely roads and the

201
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.780 
villagers fear his return.

202
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.040 
The brigand was finally caught after a

203
00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.740 
long pursuit by the authorities.

204
00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:08.720 
Play.

205
00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.560 
Play.

206
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:12.600 
She wore her hair in a neat play which

207
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.740 
complimented her simple but elegant style.

208
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.200 
She braided her hair into a neat play

209
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.920 
before heading out to the event.

210
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:22.140 
Pilate seems to be seeking some way to

211
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.940 
release Jesus.

212
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.420 
Pilate seems to be seeking some way to

213
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.280 
release Jesus.

214
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.380 
Pilate seems to be seeking some way to

215
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.220 
release Jesus without causing a riot.

216
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:32.760 
Uncommended.

217
00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.980 
He left the comment uncommended to avoid confusion.

218
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.400 
His opinion on the matter was

219
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.540 
uncommended, leaving everyone guessing
what he truly thought.

220
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:46.000 
Pilate would have none of it.

221
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.820 
Pilate would have none of it rejecting

222
00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.680 
their requests.

223
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.000 
Pilate would have none of it dismissing

224
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:52.900 
the accusation with a wave of his hand.

225
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.040 
Touching.

226
00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:56.860 
It was a deeply touching moment.

227
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.880 
The movie had a touching ending that left

228
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.180 
the audience in tears.

229
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.220 
Pilate would have gone un dÃÂugo atesselly.

230
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.340 
Pilate's nel AntarÃÂÃÂ¡.

231
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.460 
Pilate is at the highest risk ofinging

232
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:01.500 
during the rise of historicalur Lanka.

233
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.940 
Pilate can completely transfer to the

234
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:01.950 
audience in the highest risk of some way
to Percy.

235
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:01.960 
Thank you.
