00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.220 
¡Hola!

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.140 
¡Hola!

3
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.640 
Hoy vamos a leer juntos, ¿ok?

4
00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.440 
We're going to read together and this is

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.360 
all about what you've already learned and
studied, ¿ok?

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.020 
You've already learned and studied this,
so feel confident when reading.

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
You will read after me, so you will have
the pronunciation guide, ¿ok?

8
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.260 
So, vamos a leer algo de lo que tú ya has
practicado y ya has aprendido.

9
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.420 
Y vas a tener...

10
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.060 
Yo voy a leer primero para que tengas una

11
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.180 
guía de pronunciación.

12
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.340 
So, let's read about Claudia's family.

13
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.200 
Ok, vamos a leer acerca de la familia de Claudia.

14
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:41.480 
Read with me.

15
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.420 
Claudia lives in India and she has a
small family.

16
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.480 
You?

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.310 
She has two parents and two siblings, a

18
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.950 
sister and a brother.

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.580 
Her mother is a doctor and her dad is a lawyer.

20
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.250 
Her mother is a doctor and her dad is a lawyer.

21
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.600 
Claudia's sister works in St. Petersburg

22
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:34.380 
as a businesswoman
.

23
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.570 
Businesswoman and her brother, who is one
of her siblings.

24
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:56.800 
And her brother, who is one of her
siblings, is studying abroad in Moscow.

25
00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
Moscow and St. Petersburg are cities in Russia.

26
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.320 
How do you feel about this?

27
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.180 
Good?

28
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.520 
You feel well?

29
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.020 
Okay, pretty good.

30
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.620 
So, remember that every time you do this,

31
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.880 
you're progressing.

32
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.340 
Okay?

33
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.280 
You're boosting your progress.

34
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.880 
If you need to, repeat the video and read again.

35
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.260 
Again and again.

36
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.240 
Until you get custom, you get used to

37
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.920 
this kind of readings.

38
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.160 
So, we have 14 words learned, three

39
00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.800 
phrases and expressions, new ones, and
vocabulary speaking and listening.

40
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.080 
Every step forward is a victory.

41
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.900 
Cada paso hacia adelante que das es una victoria.

42
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.220 
Entonces, recuerda que para esta lectura
la puedes volver a ver el video.

43
00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.860 
Y haz los comentarios de la clase y valóralo.

44
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.480 
Okay?

45
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.640 
Make the commentaries and write the class.

46
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.840 
Bye, bye.

47
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.340
