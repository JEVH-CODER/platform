00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.380 
In the busy city, a young man decided to
run towards the beach, hoping to escape

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:05.940 
the noise of the bustling streets.

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.080 
He took a sip of his coffee and noticed a

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.580 
black hat sitting on a bench.

5
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.500 
As he walked past a store, he heard a

6
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.180 
soft buzz coming from a neon sign, and
the teacher inside smiled as she

7
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.740 
explained something to her students.

8
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.360 
He thought to himself, Now is the perfect time.

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.560 
The sun shone brightly, and he felt a
sense of peace as he crossed the wooden bridge.

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.440 
In the distance, a group of children were
singing, and their laughter filled the air.

11
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.180 
He couldn't help but smile, knowing that
life could still offer simple joys.

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.080 
As he reached the end of the road, he
stopped by a small cafe and ordered a

13
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.000 
blueberry smoothie.

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
While he waited, he overheard a couple

15
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.500 
discussing their next vacation.

16
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.980 
They mentioned wanting to tour pure

17
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.720 
natural landscapes, perhaps near the
mountains, where they could relax and

18
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.560 
enjoy the sound of the wind in the trees.

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.420 
He noticed a beige house nearby, with a

20
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.220 
beautiful garden that seemed to measure
the passage of time.

21
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.420 
As he walked, he spotted a sign that said
Think Fresh, which made him ponder about

22
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.640 
the choices he could make.

23
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.700 
The day seemed perfect, and he felt ready

24
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
to face whatever came next.

25
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.160 
I think he felt happy right after she met

26
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.280 
yet to Guy Egli -P security
It seemed to beесy with emotion, but it

27
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
absolutely was still that way, with an
unknown ,そうそう he didn't see her handicap

28
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
in the hell.

29
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
He understood everything it was beautiful

30
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.280 
and when he felt out, all of a sudden
looking around, observe everything over

31
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.660 
the past, and prove better to the day,
enjoy the future of what he does.

32
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.920
