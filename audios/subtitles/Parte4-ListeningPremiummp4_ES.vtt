00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.340 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.680 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.860 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.180 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.440 
We'll also learn about contractions.

6
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
Let's get started
.

7
00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.720 
Elision.

8
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.360 
Sometimes sounds are dropped when we

9
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.700 
speak quickly.

10
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.940 
Examples.

11
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.500 
Okay.

12
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.940 
Aquí inicia tu ejercicio.

13
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.120 
Ahora que ya estás bien familiarizado con
las frases y las palabras claves, solo

14
00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.080 
vas a escuchar la frase y la vas a repetir.

15
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.140 
I'm going to go to the doctor's tomorrow.

16
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.120 
He should have gone to the store.

17
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.100 
I would have gone if I had known.

18
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.920 
You could have told me earlier.

19
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.080 
She must have missed the train.

20
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.580 
We might have been late.

21
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.420 
Give me a call when you arrive.

22
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.340 
Let me know if you need anything.

23
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.960 
Wanna go to the movies?

24
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.800 
I gotta finish this today.

25
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.020 
It's kind of funny how that happened.

26
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.620 
I ran out of milk.

27
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.180 
I need a cup of tea.

28
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.720 
That's a lot of work.

29
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.380

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.280 
I don't know what to do.

31
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.980 
Assimilation.

32
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.340 
When two sounds are next to each other,
one may change to sound more like the other.

33
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.640 
Examples.

34
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.180 
Okay.

Could you help me with this?

40
00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.800 
Would you come with me?

41
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.340 
Did y 'all see that movie?

42
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.300 
This shop has great deals.

43
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.040 
That boy is very tall.

In Paris right now.

45
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.760 
In Paris right now.

46
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.640 
La Sierra was amazing.

47
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.380 
Goo girl did well.

48
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.280 
Green bag is on the table.

49
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.140 
Tongue cards are missing.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.820 
Linking.

51
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.980 
Sounds from one word can connect with the
next word.

52
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.380 
Examples.

Where's the nearest station?

88
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.940 
Who's coming to the party?

89
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.080 
Contractions.

90
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.420 
Contractions occur when we combine two
words to make a shorter form.

91
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.600 
Examples.

92
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.200

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
It's a beautiful day.

100
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.500 
We're having a great time.

You've got to see this.

111
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.280 
He's finished his work.

112
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.140 
She's already left.

113
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.900 
It's worked well for years.

114
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:22.500 
We've been waiting.

115
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:23.980 
They've got the tickets.

116
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.260

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.820 
He'd like some coffee.

119
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.100 
She'd appreciate your help.

120
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.780 
It'd be nice to meet her.

121
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.540 
We'd be happy to help.

122
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
They'd prefer a different time.

123
00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.960 
I'd finished by then.

124
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.860 
You'd already seen that show.

125
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.940 
He'd been waiting for hours.

126
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.020 
She'd gone home early.

127
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.080 
It had been a long day.

128
00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.900 
We'd seen that movie before.

129
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.000 
They'd already left.

130
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.000

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:46.280 
My childhood loved to get outfire.

133
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.780
