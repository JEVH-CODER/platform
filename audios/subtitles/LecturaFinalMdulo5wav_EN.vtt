00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.660 
In a suburban town, there was a
restaurant known for its delicious food

2
00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
and friendly staff.

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.040 
The owner, Jack, was proud of his place,

4
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.880 
but lately, he had noticed some strange occurrences.

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.020 
Money was missing from the cash register,

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.740 
and he suspected that someone was
stealing from him.

7
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.300 
One evening, while closing up, Jack saw a
man acting suspiciously near the back door.

8
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.820 
He decided to follow him.

9
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.880 
The man led Jack to a dark alley behind

10
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.620 
the restaurant.

11
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.720 
There, Jack discovered a group of thieves

12
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.960 
planning their next move.

13
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.620 
They were discussing how to break into

14
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
the restaurant again.

15
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.740 
Feeling a mix of fear and anger, Jack

16
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.980 
knew he had to act quickly.

17
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
He took out his phone and called the

18
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.760 
authorities, reporting what he had seen.

19
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.100 
However, before the police arrived, one

20
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.400 
of the thieves noticed Jack and shouted, Run!

21
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.640 
In the chaos, Jack managed to get away

22
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.120 
but felt guilty for not confronting them directly.

23
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.040 
He returned home and thought about how to

24
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.120 
protect his restaurant.

25
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.320 
He decided to install security cameras

26
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.920 
and hired extra staff to monitor the situation.

27
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.760 
A few days later, while reviewing the

28
00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.640 
camera footage, Jack saw something
shocking, one of his own employees, a

29
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.360 
waiter named Tom, was secretly working
with the thieves.

30
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.800 
Tom had been feeding them information
about when the restaurant would be empty.

31
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.780 
Jack felt betrayed but also knew he had
to confront Tom.

32
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.600 
When he did, Tom confessed that he was in
deep debt and thought this was the only

33
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.220 
way out.

34
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.860 
I didn't want to hurt anyone, Tom said tearfully.

35
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.740 
In a twist of fate, Jack decided to help
Tom instead of turning him in.

36
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.880 
He offered him a chance to pay off his
debts by working extra shifts at the restaurant.

37
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.500 
Their friendship changed forever, but
Jack felt it was worth it to save Tom

38
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.560 
from a life of crime.

39
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.040
