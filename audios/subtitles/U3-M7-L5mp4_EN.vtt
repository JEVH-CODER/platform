1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:01.580 
Alright, welcome to this class.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.180 
Today we're going to practice a lot.

3
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:08.540 
Now, this is sugar.

4
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.500 
It's a sugar.

5
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:19.280 
Now, for sugar, that we can't count,
unless we say, or we say, a cube of sugar.

6
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.100 
We can say, that doesn't make sense.

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.500 
That doesn't make sense, right?

8
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:34.120 
But, we could say, one cup of sugar, we
can say, if we add something, then we can

9
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.000 
say, that sugar is incontable.

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.780 
Now, we could say, much.

11
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.120 
For sustantivos incontables, like sugar,
we say much.

12
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.560 
Alright?

13
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.960 
So, for example, Is there much sugar in

14
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.400 
this cake?

15
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.120 
Dilo conmigo.

16
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.820 
Is there much sugar in this cake?

17
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.100 
Pretty good.

18
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.700 
That means, there's much sugar in this cake.

19
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.240 
Next up, we got, another way to say, a lot.

20
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.920 
Dilo conmigo.

21
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.680 
A lot.

22
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
A lot of.

23
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.040 
Like in this phrase, there's a lot of

24
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.580 
sugar in this dessert recipe.

25
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.560 
That's great.

26
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.040 
That's great.

27
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.300 
That's great.

28
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 
That's great.

29
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.120 
Otra forma en la que podemos decir, un

30
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.060 
montón de, o bastante, es lots of.

31
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.020 
Dilo conmigo.

32
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.840 
Lots of.

33
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.060 
Lots of.

34
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.100 
That's right.

35
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.680 
Excelente.

36
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.100 
Lots of significa, un montón de.

37
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
Por ejemplo, I have lots of onions.

38
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.440 
Tengo un montón de onions.

39
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.360 
Now, go, check your kitchen, revisa tu

40
00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.480 
cocina, y mira si tienes, any onion,
alguna onion.

41
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.600 
Y, dime, si tienes, lots of onions, o si
no tienes, lots of onions.

42
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.270 
Alright, that's great.

43
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.810 
Now, let's check this out here.

44
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.690 
Cuando a una persona tiene bastante, le
puedes decir a otro, feel free to grab some.

45
00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.210 
Eso significa, siéntete libre de tomar.

46
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.590 
Alright?

47
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.810 
For example, I have lots of onions.

48
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.250 
Feel free to grab some.

49
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.710 
Tengo un montón de cebollas.

50
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.630 
Siéntete libre de tomar algunas.

51
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.550 
Cuidado si te dicen eso en un
restaurante, y actúas de esta forma.

52
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.000 
Jeje.

53
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.620

Por ejemplo, we only need a few onions.

Solo necesitamos unas pocas cebollas.

63
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.560 
Like when you're gonna make a salad,

64
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.080 
cuando vas a hacer una ensalada, we only
need a few onions.

65

Pretty good.

That's great.

69
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:38.660 
That's awesome.

70
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.920 
Now, today we've learned more than 31

71
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.820 
English words and more than four expressions.

72
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.700 
We've also practiced pronunciation,

73
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.040 
listening, and cultural takeaway.

74
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.300 
Remember, believe in yourselves and in

75
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.740 
your abilities.

76
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
as well as in the abilities of the whole

77
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.800 
team that's accompanying you all
throughout this process.

78
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.640 
That's been all for today and see you in
