00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.060 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.680 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.880 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.140 
We'll also learn about contractions.

6
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:15.300 
Let's get started
.

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.220 
Elision.

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.860 
Sometimes sounds are dropped when we

9
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:19.140 
speak quickly.

10
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.160 
Examples.

11
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.540 
I'm going to go to the doctor's tomorrow.

12
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.560

13
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.480 
He shoulda gone to the store.

14
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
He shoulda.

15
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.540 
I woulda gone if I had known.

16
00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.600

17
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.600

18
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:32.800 
You coulda.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
She musta missed the train.

20
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.040 
She musta.

21
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.460 
We mighta been late.

22
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.620

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.840

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:50.220 
Gotta.

31
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.300 
It's kind of funny how that happened.

32
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.060 
Kinda.

33
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.280 
I ran out of milk.

34
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.820

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.500

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.240 
Cuppa.

37
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.980 
That's a lot of work.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.720 
Lotta.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.560

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.120 
D 'know.

43
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.020 
Assimilation.

44
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.180 
When two sounds are next to each other,

45
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.840 
one may change to sound more like the other.

46
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.800 
Examples.

47
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.180

Wanna.

53

55
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.060

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.700 
That boy.

64
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.940 
In Paris.

65
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.040 
Last year was amazing.

66
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
Last year.

67
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.860 
Good girl did well.

68
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.160

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.260 
Tum cards.

73
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.180 
Linking.

74
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.400 
Sounds from one word can connect with the

75
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.640 
next word.

76
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.680 
Examples.

77
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:58.580

Do it yourself.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.420 
Do it.

Get up.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.520 
Turn off the lights.

89
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.240 
Turn off.

90
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.800 
Put it over there.

91
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.540 
Put it.

92
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.020

Call up.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.620 
Turn it.

104
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.960 
Reduction.

105
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.780 
Some sounds become weaker or change to

106
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.720 
the schwa vowel, which sounds like, uh, examples
.

107
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.680 
Can you help me with this problem?

108
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.580 
Can you help me?

They need help?

112
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.980 
D 'ya.

113
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.800 
What do you think about this?

114
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.660 
What do you?

115
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.800 
I'm going to the store.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.200 
I'm.

117
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.400 
He's always late.

118
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.680 
He's.

119
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.060 
She's coming over later.

120
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.360 
She's.

121
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.180 
They're not here yet.

122
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.340 
They're.

123
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.600 
We're going on vacation.

124
00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.020 
We're.

125
00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.820 
You're the best
.

126
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:02.120 
You're.

127
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.080 
It's going to rain.

128
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.240 
It's.

129
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.920 
There's a problem with the car.

130
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:07.340 
There's.

131
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.560 
Where's the nearest station?

132
00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.660 
Where's.

133
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.380 
Who's coming to the party?

134
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.640 
Who's.

135
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.760 
Contractions.

136
00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.000 
Contractions occur when we combine two
words to make a shorter form.

137
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.120 
Examples.

138
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.460 
I'm going to the store now.

139
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.700

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.480

You're invited to the party.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.140 
You're.

144
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.540 
He's already finished.

145
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:29.540 
He's.

146
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.680 
She's leaving soon.

147
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.060 
She's.

148
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.120 
It's a beautiful day.

149
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.360 
It's.

150
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.360 
We're having a great time.

151
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.440 
We're.

152
00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.600 
They're going to be late.

153
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.820 
There.

154
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.160 
I'll see you later.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.020 
I'll.

156
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.380 
You'll do great.

157
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.680 
You'll.

158
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.820 
He'll join us later.

159
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:45.240 
He'll.

160
00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.340 
She'll be here soon.

161
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.200 
She'll.

162
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
It'll be fun.

163
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.560 
It'll.

164
00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.180

165
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:53.060 
We'll.

166
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.260 
They'll arrive tomorrow.

167
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.700 
They'll.

168
00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.120 
I've finished my homework.

169
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.300 
I've.

170
00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.720 
You've got to see this.

171
00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:59.040 
You've.

172
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.680 
He's finished his work.

173
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.740 
He's.

174
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
She's already left.

175
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:04.160 
She's.

176
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.100 
It's worked well for years.

177
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.080 
It's.

178
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.000 
We've been waiting.

179
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.400 
We've.

180
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.840 
They've got the tickets.

181
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.120 
They've.

182
00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.020 
I'd love to go.

183
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.000 
I'd.

184
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.820 
You'd better hurry.

185
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:16.040 
You'd.

186
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.440 
He'd.

187
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.680 
He'd like some coffee.

188
00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.980 
He'd.

189
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.940 
She'd appreciate your help.

190
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.080 
She'd.

191
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.560 
It'd be nice to meet her.

192
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.720 
It'd.

193
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.920 
We'd be happy to help.

194
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.120 
We'd.

195
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.960 
They'd prefer a different time.

196
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.300 
They'd.

197
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.480 
I'd finish by then.

198
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.640 
I'd.

199
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.200 
You'd have loved the show.

200
00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.420 
You'd.

201
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.980 
He'd been waiting for hours.

202
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.380 
He'd.

203
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.360 
She'd gone home early.

204
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.640 
She'd.

205
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.000 
It'd been a long day.

206
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.240 
It'd.

207
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.240 
We'd seen that movie before.

208
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.080 
We'd.

209
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.580 
They'd already left.

210
00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.580 
They'd.
