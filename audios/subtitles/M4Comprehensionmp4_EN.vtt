1
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:19.420 
Later, she found out that Carson had
another family that he hid from her.

2
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.920 
Despite their best efforts, their
marriage fell apart and ended in divorce.

3
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.620 
Pregunta.

4
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.100 
Question.

5
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.020 
Why did Sonia Carson, the woman in the
story, divorced her husband?

6
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.020 
Numbers two.

7
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.820 
Second one.

8
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.500 
After the meeting, Benny felt really sad.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.140 
He thought that he was not smart.

10
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.540 
His mother, however, believed in him.

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.540 
She told him that he was not stupid, but

12
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.740 
very smart, and that he just needed to
work harder.

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.560 
Question.

14
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.300 
Why was Benny sad?

15
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.200 
Third.

16
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.950 
Now, Sonia works multiple jobs, like

17
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.570 
cleaning and babysitting, to support her family.

18
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.370 
Sonia can't read or cry, and this scares her.

19
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.090 
She's worried that her sons might end up
facing the same challenges.

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.050 
She even tells her psychiatrist about her
thoughts of ending her life, which

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.790 
worries him.

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.810 
What worries Sonia?

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.370 
What is she thinking to do?

24
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.750
