00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.780 
What responsibilities does Edith give
Christopher before she leaves?

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.380 
Why do you think Christopher agrees to
his mother's instructions, even though he

3
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
enjoys freedom and playing outside?

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.730 
What would you do if you were left in

5
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.390 
charge of your siblings for a day?

6
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.070 
Would you follow the instructions, or

7
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.190 
would you take a risk?

8
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.200 
Why do you think Christopher's friends

9
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.880 
are encouraging him to leave the house?

10
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.270 
How does Samuel react to Christopher's

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.610 
decision to go to the beach?

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.430 
What would you do if your friends

13
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
pressured you to go somewhere against
your parents' wishes?

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.370 
Would you be able to say no?

15
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.960 
Why do Christopher's friends think he's

16
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.440 
faking his distress in the water?

17
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.710 
Why do the friends choose not to help

18
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.610 
Christopher and instead run away?

19
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.600 
What would you do if you were in

20
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.100 
Christopher's position, struggling in the
water with friends who didn't take you seriously?

21
00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.720 
How would you feel about those friends afterward?

22
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.480 
What emotions does Edith experience when

23
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.700 
she finds out that Christopher has left
the house?

24
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.470 
Why do you think the other children's
parents deny knowing where

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.150 
Christopher
went

26
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.720 
?

27
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.660 
How does the neighbor's information

28
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.420 
change Edith's response?

29
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.720 
What might she be feeling when she learns

30
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.290 
Christopher went to the beach?

31
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.370 
What emotions do you think Edith

32
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.530 
experiences during her search for
Christopher at the beach?

33
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.650 
What would you do if a family member went missing
?

34
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.860 
What steps would you take, and whom would
you reach out to for help?

35
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.640 
Do you think Edith might have done
something differently to prevent

36
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.000 
Christopher's disappearance?

37
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.480 
Why or why not?

38
00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.050 
How does Christopher survive his ordeal,
and who helps him?

39
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.670 
Why do you think Christopher doesn't
remember what happened during his time in

40
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.570 
the jungle?

41
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.650 
What would you do if you were Christopher

42
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.260 
and were found by strangers after being
lost for days?

43
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.540 
How does Christopher change after his experience?

44
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.300 
Why do you think he becomes more responsible?

45
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.140 
How might this experience affect how
Christopher interacts with his friends in

46
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.120 
the future?

47
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.900 
What would you do if you were reminded of

48
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.180 
a past mistake every time you saw a
specific place?

49
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.180 
Would it change your behavior or decisions?

50
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.280 
Or maybe you could hear what would he do?

51
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.240 
What's change here in the meantime?

52
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.860 
What would he do if he to say?

53
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.360 
Dan's.
