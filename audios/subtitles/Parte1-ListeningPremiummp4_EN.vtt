00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.320 
Today, we're going to talk about how
native speakers connect words in English.

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.700 
This is called connected speech.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.860 
Often, sounds are reduced or changed when

4
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.180 
words are spoken together.

5
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.000
